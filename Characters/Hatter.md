# "If you died today or tonight, the Minion & Demon players may choose new Minion & Demon characters to be."

## Summary
The Hatter allows the evil players to change characters.

- Each player with a Minion or Demon character may choose to become any character of the same type as their current character.
- They may choose not to change characters.
- If a player becomes a new character, they gain the new ability, even if it was a "you start knowing" ability or a once per game ability that had already been used.
- Once a player has changed character, their previous character ability has no further effect on the game.
- If a player dies then becomes the Hatter, the evil players do not change characters tonight.
- Once a character has been chosen, a second player cannot choose the same character. If it is already in play, the player with that character must choose a new character.
## How to Run
If the Hatter dies, mark them with the “Tea Party Tonight” reminder. During that night, wake the Minions and Demon. Show them the “This Character Selected You” info token, then the Hatter token. Each player either shakes their head no or points to another character of the same type as their current character. If a second player would end up with the same character as another player, shake your head no and gesture for them to choose again. Put them to sleep. Remove the “Tea Party Tonight” reminder. Change each player to the character they chose.

>Optional rule: if the Hatter dies, allow the Demon to become a Minion, and a Minion to become a Demon. This may cause some chaos among the evil team as they try to communicate silently at night about who wants to be the Demon.
### Examples
>The Hatter dies. The [[Ojo]] chooses to become the [[No Dashii]] and the [[Devil's Advocate]] chooses to become the [[Scarlet Woman]].

>The [[Vigormortis]] has killed their [[Pit-Hag]], then later kills the Hatter. Both players choose to stay the same characters, so that they don't lose the effects of the [[Vigormortis]].

>The [[Assassin]] kills a player. The Hatter is executed. That night, the [[Assassin]] becomes the [[Mastermind]] and the [[Mastermind]] shakes their head no to stay the [[Mastermind]]. The Storyteller shakes their head no because the [[Mastermind]] character has been chosen already, and gestures for the [[Mastermind]] player to choose again, so they choose [[Assassin]]. The new [[Assassin]] then uses their new ability to kill a player.

## Interesting Interactions
If the Hatter is drunk or poisoned when they die, nothing happens. If a Minion or Demon is drunk or poisoned when they change character, this still works as it's due to the Hatter ability, not their own, though they'd still be drunk or poisoned with whatever new character they change to. 

- [[Alchemist]]: If the Minion whose ability the [[Alchemist]] has comes into play, the [[Alchemist]] gains a new ability instead. 
- [[Apprentice]]: An [[Apprentice]] with a Minion ability is not a Minion and is not affected by the Hatter ability 
- [[Bounty Hunter]]: The [[Bounty Hunter]] evil Townsfolk is not a Minion or Demon, so does not choose a new character. 
- [[Chambermaid]]: A player waking to make only a Hatter choice and nothing else does not count as waking to the [[Chambermaid]] - it's not their own ability. 
- [[Cult Leader]]: An evil [[Cult Leader]] is not a Minion or Demon, so does not choose a new character. 
- [[Damsel]]: Even if the Minions have changed characters, a used guess is still used. 
- [[Evil Twin]]: If an [[Evil Twin]] ability comes into play through the Hatter, you should wake each twin individually to show them who their twin is and what character it is. Remember that the good twin doesn't have to be alive and generally shouldn't be if this happens in late game as this can mean the good team cannot win. 
- [[Fearmonger]]: If a player becomes a [[Fearmonger]], their choices as their previous character aren’t relevant to the [[Fearmonger]] announcement, their first pick will cause an announcement regardless of who it is. 
- [[Godfather]]: If a [[Godfather]] comes into play, they'd immediately learn the in-play Outsiders, whether those Outsiders are dead or alive. 
- [[Legion]]: Jinx - If the Hatter dies and [[Legion]] is in play, nothing happens. If the Hatter dies and an evil player chooses [[Legion]], all current evil players become [[Legion]]. 
- [[Leviathan]]: Jinx - If the [[Hatter]] dies on or after day 5, the Demon cannot choose [[Leviathan]]. 
- [[Lil’ Monsta]]: A [[Lil’ Monsta]] holder would be able to choose another Demon, as usual for Demons. Jinx - If a Demon chooses [[Lil' Monsta]], they also choose a Minion to become and babysit [[Lil' Monsta]] tonight. 
- [[Lleech]]: A [[Lleech]] coming into play would immediately select a host, then follow that by choosing a kill. 
- [[Lunatic]]: A [[Lunatic]] can be given the choice to change characters as if they were the real Demon and a Hatter had died, regardless of whether the actual Hatter died or not. 
- [[Marionette]]: If a player chooses [[Marionette]] with the Hatter ability, you should tell them they're a good character and tell the Demon they are the [[Marionette]]. There may also be a future jinx for the [[Marionette]]. 
- [[Plague Doctor]]: If the in-play Minion abilities change due to the Hatter, this does not affect a [[Plague Doctor]] granted Storyteller ability. 
- [[Po]]: A [[Po]] that comes into play would have the choice to kill no-one or 1 player - choices as a previous character are not relevant for the Po ability. 
- [[Preacher]]: A Minion chosen by the [[Preacher]] that changes character is still affected by the [[Preacher]] ability. 
- [[Pukka]]: If the Demon changes away from being a [[Pukka]], the previously poisoned player immediately sobers and will not die tonight. 
- [[Recluse]]: It's possible to wake the [[Recluse]] as if they were a Minion or Demon to allow them to change characters, but this is very rarely fun, so recommended against. 
- [[Riot]]: Jinx - If the Hatter dies, [[Riot]] is in play and a [[Riot]] chooses a different Demon, a normal evil team is created from the Riot players. If the Hatter dies and the Demon chooses [[Riot]], Minions become [[Riot]] too. 
- [[Undertaker]]: The [[Undertaker]] learns the information that was true at the time of execution, regardless of whether the executed player's character changes afterwards. 
- [[Vigormortis]]: A Demon that changes from a [[Vigormortis]] to something else while having killed Minions to maintain their abiities in death will cause those abilities to immediately be lost. However, if the Vigor stays in play, a Vigor-killed Minion can change character and continue to use their new ability. 
- [[Zombuul]]: An already-dead player that chooses to become a [[Zombuul]] does not return to life as a once-killed [[Zombuul]], they are already dead.

## Tips and Tricks
- Don’t die! As soon as you die, the evil team gets to power up to become the exact combination they think will be most effective, regardless of the prior game balance. And that could be overpowering if the evil team can do it with impunity when they want to.

- Die as early as possible! The sooner you die, the less time the evil team have to work out which characters are going to be most effective against the characters arrayed on the good team. It also increases the odds that you are confirmed by later Minion/Demon activity contradicting the early indications, helping town work out the Outsider count.

- Mid-game is the worst time for you to die. Just as the good team are getting to grips with their information and tracking down evil players, your ability can completely switch that information around and make it incredibly hard to parse, just when you need it most to narrow down between the smaller group of candidates remaining.

- The day after you die, tell everyone that you were the Hatter! They need to adjust their choices accordingly to adjust to a potential change of characters on the evil team, whether that’s night choices or nominations and voting choices to hunt the Demon effectively.

- After you die, try to see if you can spot what the Minions/Demons have changed to based on game state changes from the early game. Maybe some people’s information has gone weird when it was previously reliable, maybe a suspected evil player is suddenly much happier to die, maybe there was an extra death you can’t explain. Any clues you can garner about your new evil team are even more crucial than they would ordinarily be, with the reduced time available to work out your new evil team.

## Bluffing
- You don’t want to die! Take advantage of the fact that the good team will be wary of killing a Hatter to stay alive longer than you would do otherwise. You can possibly even take this bluff to the final 3 and beyond if you can keep playing up the fear of what might happen if you die.

- If you do die, see if your fellow evils can bluff a change of Minion or Demon abilities affecting them to back up your bluff. It depends which evil characters are on the script, but this can have effects far beyond implying that you yourself are good. It can also send the good team off down a rabbit hole of theorising entirely around a Demon type that isn’t in play and never has been.

- Hatters are often mad! They like to claim to be other things to try to survive as long as possible and conceal themselves so the evil team can’t use them to switch around their characters when it’s most effective for them. This makes it a great fallback bluff for you if an initial bluff has gone awry or if your initial bluff doesn't give you a good reason not to be executed when the pressure comes on.

- Make a good faith effort after you die to try to solve what the changes were to sell your bona fides. You might be able to be the butter in the gears that makes the good team’s calculations fall apart by distracting them constantly with theories about different Minion and Demon types to expand the list of possible explanations for any given situation so much farther than it might be otherwise.

- If you are the Demon bluffing Hatter, try to make it look like weaker Minion/Demons in play. This increases the threat of your death as the evil team being able to pick the most powerful options possible is terrifying for any good team and will potentially allow you to survive through the whole game. You will, however, need to have good reasons prepared for why the evil team hasn’t just killed you at night at any point. So it might be worth claiming something else publicly and Hatter privately to dead good players and leaning on their support to keep you alive if the living come after you. bluff.
