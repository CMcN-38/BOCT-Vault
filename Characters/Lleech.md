# "Each night*, choose a player: they die. You start by choosing an alive player: they are poisoned - you die if (& only if) they die."

## Summary
The Lleech lives if their host lives, and dies if their host dies.

- On the first night, the Lleech chooses a player, who is poisoned for the rest of the game.
- If this player is alive, the Lleech cannot die. If the Lleech is executed, the Storyteller tells the group that the player lives, but not why.
- If the player that the Lleech chose dies, the Lleech dies as well. If this means that only one or two players are left alive, good still wins, because the Demon is dead.
- From the second night onwards, players that the Lleech attacks die but are not poisoned.
- If a Lleech is created mid-game, they poison a player that night. They must choose an alive player.
## How to Run
During the first night, wake the Lleech. They point at any player. That player is **poisoned**—mark them with the **POISONED** reminder. Put the Lleech to sleep.

Each night except the first, wake the Lleech. They point at any player. That player **dies**—mark them with the **DEAD** reminder. Put the Lleech to sleep.

If the Lleech would die but the player marked with the Lleech’s **POISONED** reminder is alive, the Lleech does not die. If the player marked with the Lleech’s **POISONED** reminder **dies**, the Lleech **dies** and the good team wins.

>When giving false information to a good player poisoned by the Lleech, make sure this information seems true. If the good player believes it to be false, they will quickly execute themselves and win the game.

>Optional rule: if the host dies while the Lleech is drunk or poisoned, the Lleech dies too. (This prevents the situation where the good team are unable to win due to the host being dead and the Lleech being alive.)
### Examples
>The Lleech poisons the [Noble](https://wiki.bloodontheclocktower.com/Noble). The [Noble](https://wiki.bloodontheclocktower.com/Noble) learns false information. The Lleech is executed, but does not die. The next day, the [Noble](https://wiki.bloodontheclocktower.com/Noble) is executed. The [Noble](https://wiki.bloodontheclocktower.com/Noble) and the Lleech die. Good wins.

>The Lleech poisons the [Farmer](https://wiki.bloodontheclocktower.com/Farmer). The Lleech is made drunk by the [Courtier](https://wiki.bloodontheclocktower.com/Courtier). The poisoned [Farmer](https://wiki.bloodontheclocktower.com/Farmer) dies, and the game continues because the Lleech is also drunk. The drunk Lleech is executed and dies, and good wins.

## Discord How to Run
On the Lleech’s first night, the Lleech chooses an alive player, that player is poisoned from now on. If at any point the Lleech is supposed to die (whether by execution or being killed at night or otherwise), they do not die. If the poisoned player dies, the Lleech also dies simultaneously. Every night after the first, the Lleech chooses a player, that player dies. 

When the Lleech is drunk or poisoned, the host is sober. If the host dies during this time, the Lleech is unaffected. If the Lleech themselves dies when drunk or poisoned, they die as their ability cannot prevent them from dying while drunk/poisoned. If the Lleech’s host is drunk/poisoned, this does not affect the Lleech. 

The Lleech still registers as the Demon and their host still registers as their respective type, the selecting them does not change anything about their registration. Note that the host can be any alive player, regardless of type. 

If a new Lleech is created after the first night, they are woken immediately on becoming the Lleech to choose their host. They are then put back to sleep and reawaken at the Lleech turn (if applicable) to kill.

## Interesting Interactions
- [[Exorcist]]: If the Lleech is Exorcised after their first night they don’t wake but their host remains poisoned and the Lleech still cannot die unless the host does. 
- [[Fool]]/[[Pacifist]]/[[Sailor]]/[[Tea Lady]]/[[Devil’s Advocate]]: There is no difference between the Lleech being executed and one of the former abilities protecting from death on execution – all of them result in “is executed and does not die.” 
- [[Monk]]: If the host is chosen by the [[Monk]], they become sober for that night. 
- [[Mayor]]: The [[Mayor]] does not bounce being picked as the host by the Lleech. Once they are poisoned, they do not have an ability and therefore cannot win in final 3, nor can they bounce kills in the night. 
- [[Professor]]: If the Lleech host has died and therefore the Lleech has died too and the Lleech host is resurrected by the [[Professor]], the Lleech is not also resurrected. 
- [[Slayer]]: Jinx - "If the [[Slayer]] slays the Lleech's host, the host dies." (And, for clarity, this of course means the Lleech dies too if they are sober/healthy.) 
- [[Snake Charmer]]: If the [[Snake Charmer]] hits the Lleech, they choose a new host when they become the Lleech. 
- [[Soldier]]: If picked as host by the Lleech, they are not poisoned. However, if they die for any reason (execution, [[Lycanthrope]] etc), the Lleech dies too. 
- [[Goon]]: If selected as host on N1, makes the Lleech drunk until dusk and the [[Goon]] turns evil. If the [[Goon]] is then executed that first day, the Lleech does not die as they are drunk. The [[Goon]] is sober all game, but if the [[Goon]] dies after the first day, the Lleech dies too. 
- [[Lunatic]]: If the [[Lunatic]] thinks they are a Lleech, the actual Demon is told who they picked as host on N1, but this is not differentiated from, for example, the [[Lunatic]] thinking they’re a [[Pukka]] and choosing on N1 – the actual Demon would not know the difference. 
- [[Assassin]]: Can kill the Lleech. 
- [[Mastermind]]: Jinx: "If the [[Mastermind]] is alive and the Lleech's host dies by execution, the Lleech lives but loses their ability." 
- [[Pit-Hag]]: If a new Demon is made, the host still has to be killed in order to kill the Lleech, the [[Pit-Hag]] cannot override the Lleech ability to not die. 
- [[Travellers]]: Can be chosen as the host but this is probably not recommended as if the Traveller leaves, they die and therefore the Lleech dies. 
- [[Barista]]: If [[Barista]] doubled not on their first night, they kill twice. If [[Barista]] doubled on their first night, they choose two players, both of whom are poisoned from now on. However, both must die in order for the Lleech to die. 
- [[Gangster]]/[[Gunslinger]]/[[Harlot]]: Cannot kill the Lleech

## Tips and Tricks
- Communicate with your Minions as early as possible, and tell them who you have poisoned. The whole evil team will need to collaborate well from the very beginning to keep this player alive. Let's say you turn the [[Preacher]] into your host, poisoning them. Not only can you ignore them as a threat, since they cannot affect any of the Minions, but you actively need to keep them alive for final three.

- Poison one of your neighbours, because then you can keep your host close and under your thumb. You can find out what their poisoned information is and try to manipulate the game to make it seem legitimate, making them disbelieve they're poisoned.

- Poison someone on the other side of the circle, to draw attention as far away from you as possible.

- Avoid being executed. Even though you cannot die by execution, the good team learning who the Demon is can often be enough information for them to win the game. Once the players know that the Demon is the Lleech they are likely to be locking you out from discussions, and trying to figure out which of the good players is the host.

- Who you choose as your host can have a big impact on the game, and it's a choice you have to make blindly. If you choose a character who only gets information at the start of the game, it can be really difficult for them to figure out that they've been poisoned, making it easier for you to hide the host. However, they're much more likely to want to go along with being executed for all sorts of reasons since they have no ability to contribute to the game. If the [[Noble]] is the host, and there seems to be a lot of resistance to executing them when they're okay with it, it might telegraph really strongly that they're the host.

- If there are just 3 players alive, getting executed is a safe strategy. Because the host is still alive, you will be executed but will not die. Then the game goes to night with three alive and you can kill the one last player that isn't the host. Note, it's really important in this situation to NOT kill the host, because otherwise you will also immediately die. This creates a tie, meaning good wins.

- If for some reason the group seems to be circling in on the host to execute, you may need to carefully redirect attention away. If you make a lot of noise about *NOT* executing a specific player, this can come across as really suspicious. Instead, perhaps just point out someone else as a really big target, even if this means throwing one of your Minions under the bus. The best strategy is to get to final day without having much shade on the host.

- In a normal Demon game, the priority is to protect the Demon from being killed. In a Lleech game, the priority is to create as much misinformation as possible to disguise the host. That way even if there is a person who doubts their information, it's just one among many sources of misinformation.

- The Lleech can be particularly tricky, because effectively one of the members of the "team" is good. They are not aligned with you and you don't have a lot of control over them or their poisoning. It is perfectly fine to suggest to the Storyteller possible pieces of misinformation to give out through the poisoning, but the Storyteller does not need to listen to that request.

- If the evil team has the upper hand at the end of the game, then the Storyteller might make the poisoning of the host really noisy as a way to offset that, especially if for some reason they have flown under the radar the whole game and the good team hasn't even discovered that it's a Lleech game.

## Fighting the Lleech
- Figure out whether or not a Lleech is in play. This information determines what your goal of the game is, since until you know, you won't know which players to execute. Once you know it's a Lleech game, then the key is to find and kill the host instead.

- Find the poisoned player. If every good player who thinks that they might be poisoned tells the group this, then the good team should be able to make a few guesses as to who the Lleech target is.
    - If someone is getting bogus info: execute them - chances are they're the host or maybe just a Minion sowing bad information. Win Win!
    - If you think you're getting bogus info: volunteer to be executed and take yourself out of the problem.

- Use info characters to verify other players' information to try and narrow down the possible options for poisoned candidates. Remember that only one player can be poisoned by the Lleech and it doesn't move. If you can verify a player as sober and healthy, they cannot be the Lleech host.

- If you don't have any good candidates for who the host is based on the information you have at hand, look for characters that seem to be surviving in odd ways. The following are good options for characters who are Lleech hosts flying under the radar:
    - A confirmed good player or any public high priority target that has survived the whole game, such as the [[Balloonist]] who has come out publicly; or
    - A start info character that seems to just be hanging in there, such as the [[Clockmaker]] that hasn't really done much since the start of the game and has even volunteered to be executed; or
    - A once per game ability character that has used their ability, such as the [[Fisherman]] who has acted upon their hint but it didn't seem to do much.

- Don't forget to find out who the evil players are! While this won't win the game directly, executing the Demon is still great information. More importantly, it's very unlikely that the Demon will choose one of their own Minions as a host, so you can probably eliminate them as options.

- Since the chance of you finding out that it's a Lleech game is higher than not, if you get down to the final day and you're not sure, it's usually safer to run with the assumption that it's not a Lleech game.
