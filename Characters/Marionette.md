# "You think you are a good character, but you are not. The Demon knows who you are. [You neighbor the Demon]"

## Summary
The Marionette doesn't know that they are a Minion.

- The Marionette draws either a Townsfolk or an Outsider token from the bag, but is secretly the Marionette.
- The Marionette neighbors the Demon. There are no players sitting in between the Marionette and the Demon.
- The Demon knows which player is the Marionette.
- On the first night, the Marionette does not wake to learn the other evil players, and the other Minions do not learn the Marionette.
- The good ability that the Marionette thinks they have doesn’t work, but the Storyteller pretends it does. It is just as if this player is the Drunk.
- The Marionette registers as evil, and as a Minion.
## How to Run
While setting up the game, before putting tokens in the bag, remove the Marionette token and add any Townsfolk token.

If there are three Minions in play, remove another Minion token and add another Townsfolk token. During the first night, swap a good player’s character token with a not-in-play Minion character token. Wake this player, show them the **YOU ARE** info token then their Minion character token, then the **YOU ARE** info token then a thumbs down, then put them to sleep. This player is now an evil Minion. (_This ensures that only one Minion token is in the bag, so at least one good player will neighbor the Demon._)

During the first night, mark a good player neighboring the Demon with the **IS THE MARIONETTE** reminder. Wake the Demon. Point to the player marked **IS THE MARIONETTE** and show the Marionette character token. Put the Demon to sleep.

Treat the Marionette as if they were drunk. They wake when their good character would wake, may get false information, do not wake during the Minion Info step etc.
### Examples
>Marianna is the Marionette, but thinks she is the [[Undertaker]]. She wakes each night to learn who was executed that day, but her information is often wrong. Halfway through the game, the Demon tells her that she is the Marionette.

>Lachlan is the Demon. He tells Sarah that she is the Marionette. Lachlan is lying. There is no Marionette.

>The Demon tells Ben that he is the Marionette. Ben thinks he is the [[Fortune Teller]], but he isn’t. Ben doesn’t believe the Demon, and executes them. Good wins.

## Setup 
There are two options for how to set up a Marionette game: 
### Option 1 
When putting tokens in the bag, if there are two or fewer Minions in the game, add one extra Townsfolk token and remove the Marionette token. If there are three Minions in the game, put two extra Townsfolk in and remove the Marionette and a second Minion token (this guarantees the random draw will produce at least one good player neighbouring the Demon). When tokens are returned, put the “Is the Marionette” reminder next to one of the Demon’s neighbours – the Marionette must be explicitly a direct neighbour to the Demon, there can be no players in between. The Marionette can think they are either a Townsfolk or Outsider.

If there are three Minions in the game, you will now need to select a good player and, on the first night, wake them and tell them they are in fact an evil Minion, showing them which Minion they are instead. It is generally recommended to make that now-Minion’s previous character one of the Demon bluffs to avoid the evil team getting a free extra bluff from this process. 

Note that this means the Marionette can affect the Townsfolk/Outsider ratio depending on whether the Marionette thinks they are a Townsfolk or an Outsider. 

### Option 2 
Take the Demon and Marionette tokens out of the bag and put two extra Townsfolk in. After the tokens have been returned, choose a neighbouring pair of good players to become the Demon and Marionette. Swap the former’s token for the relevant Demon token and mark the latter with the “Is the Marionette” reminder. Wake the Demon and tell them they are the evil Demon, who the Marionette is and make the token the now-Demon drew one of the 3 not-in-play bluffs. 

This method allows you to both maintain the Town/Outsider ratio if you choose to and avoid other setup-affecting characters more easily, but removes some of the randomisation of who gets to be evil from the game and introduces your own (Storyteller) potential biases about who to make evil. It can also make the players feel more manipulated than if it’s just random chance that they pulled a red token.
## Discord How to Run
On the first night, wake the Demon. Point to the Marionette player and show the Marionette token. The Marionette does not wake during Minion Info – they think they have a good ability, they don’t think they’re a Minion. The fellow Minions also do not learn who the Marionette is. 

If the Marionette is made drunk or poisoned during the game, this has no effect, they should still be deceived to think they’re the character they pulled from the bag. Similarly when they die, they should not learn anything new, they should be treated exactly as their perceived character would when dead.
## Interesting Interactions
Fair warning to you all, writing up this guide made me spot a fair number of oddities with the Marionette, so Steven has been updating jinxes/confirming rulings on the fly, so this one might change a few times over the coming week as he finalises some of those updates. 

- [[Balloonist]]: jinx: "If the Marionette thinks that they are the [[Balloonist]], +1 Outsider was added." 
- [[Bounty Hunter]]: needs to be decided to be the Marionette before you tell another player they’re evil thanks to the [[Bounty Hunter]] ability. 
- [[Cannibal]]: If the Marionette is eaten by the [[Cannibal]], the [[Cannibal]] is poisoned, so should generally be deceived that they have the ability the Marionette thought they had. 
- [[Chambermaid]]: If the ability the Marionette thinks they have causes them to wake, that’s the Marionette ability making them wake, so [[Chambermaid]] gets a 1. 
- [[Courtier]]: Picking the Marionette at any point does nothing. On night 1 the Marionette ability of thinking they’re good and neighbouring the Demon has already happened. On other nights you would still deceive a drunk Marionette that their ability is working, i.e. you’d still make them think they’re a good character. 
- [[Dreamer]]/[[Ravenkeeper]]/[[Undertaker]]/[[Harlot]]: See Marionette as this is the player’s true character. 
- [[Mathematician]]: The Marionette’s supposed good ability works abnormally due to their own ability, so does not register to the [[Mathematician]]. 
- [[Poppy Grower]]: Jinxed: "When the [[Poppy Grower]] dies, the Demon learns the Marionette but the Marionette learns nothing." 
- [[Preacher]]: cannot stop the Marionette placement or prevent the Demon from knowing about the Marionette – the Marionette ability happens before the [[Preacher]] picks on night 1. However, a Marionette, once picked, no longer has anything that makes them “think they are a good character” and so will no longer be woken up to use their ability at night. They would be told that they have been chosen by the [[Preacher]]. They would not, however, be told they are evil - the final rulebook explicitly states that players learn their alignment at the earliest opportunity after it changes. Therefore, if a Marionette loses their ability, they are not told that they are evil, because their alignment has not changed. In this case, of course, they would know for certain they were a Minion as soon as they were told about being chosen by the [[Preacher]]. 
- [[Snake Charmer]]/[[Barber]]/[[Pit-Hag]]/[[Fang Gu]]/[[Imp]]/[[Lil’ Monsta]]/[[Matron]]: If the Demon moves mid-game, this does not affect the Marionette, their neighbouring the Demon is a setup ability and has no effect later in the game. The new Demon would, however, be told who the Marionette is. 
- [[Goon]]: The Marionette choosing the Goon with the ability they think they have would turn the [[Goon]] evil. 
- [[Lunatic]]: There are two ways of viewing this interaction and Steven has confirmed he’s happy with either provided the ST tells their players which they run. 1) The Marionette cannot think they are the [[Lunatic]] as the Lunatic thinks they are evil, which contradicts the Marionette thinking they’re good, so a [[Lunatic]] cannot be the Marionette. 2) the Marionette can think they are a good character that themselves thinks they are the Demon. Either way, a [[Lunatic]] could be told they have a Marionette if there is a Marionette on the script. 
- [[Recluse]]: The Marionette can neighbour the [[Recluse]] if the [[Recluse]] registers as the Demon! Technically you can also tell the [[Recluse]] who the Marionette is, but that’d be outing a player who doesn’t even know they’re evil to a good player, so probably better to still tell the actual Demon who the Marionette is, which also has the added joy of telling the Demon one of two players must be the [[Recluse]]
- [[Snitch]]: jinxed - "The Marionette does not learn 3 not in-play characters. The Demon learns an extra 3 instead." 
- [[Pit-Hag]]: If a good player is turned into the Marionette mid-game, they are functionally turned into the [[Drunk]] – you can continue to treat them as though they were the good character they thought they were but they would be poisoned from then on. You could, similar to someone being turned into the [[Drunk]], choose to tell them that they changed into a different good character if you wish. The Demon would also be told who they were. If the Marionette themselves is turned into another character, they would be told their new character, but they would not be told they are evil – see [[Preacher]]. 
- [[Imp]]: A Marionette that catches a starpass would be told they are now an [[Imp]]. You do not tell them they're evil - see [[Preacher]]. 
- [[Lil’ Monsta]]: Jinx with Marionette is "The Marionette neighbors a Minion, not the Demon. The Marionette is not woken to choose who takes the [[Lil' Monsta]] token." Note that Lil’ Monsta Minions would know as soon as they woke up together (but the Marionette didn’t) that the leftover Minion is the Marionette. Technically you should show “the Demon” who the Marionette is and the Minions may not realise the implication that one Minion is not waking with the rest, so it is usually worth confirming with the first babysitter that the Minion who didn’t wake is, in fact, the Marionette. 
- [[Vortox]]: The Marionette is not Townsfolk, so can get true info in a [[Vortox]] game.
- [[Apprentice]]: Depends when the [[Apprentice]] arrives. Technically, a Traveller is told their alignment and, if evil, who the Demon is as soon as they arrive, so if they arrive during the day you can’t then give an evil [[Apprentice]] the Marionette ability that night as they’d already know they were evil. If they arrive at night, however, you technically can give them the Marionette ability if you really want to… You’d tell them they were good and had a specific Townsfolk ability but they’d not actually have it. Definitely a “technically legal but not fun” situation though. 
- [[Barista]]: Sober/healthy/true info has same result with Marionette as [[Drunk]] – take your pick of whether you believe a Barista’d [[Drunk]] can still get arbitrary info or not, just make sure you tell your players which you rule once you know you’ve got a [[Barista]] in town on a Marionette or [[Drunk]] script. [[Barista]] double ability should be used to deceive the Marionette that they have two uses of the ability they think they have. Technically [[Barista]] doubling on the first night would result in telling the Demon who they are twice too… . 
- [[Bone Collector]]: Picking the Marionette would allow the Marionette another night/day of the ability they think they have.
## Tips and Tricks
- As a Marionette, you are essentially an evil [[Drunk]] - not only do you not have the ability you think you do, but you don't have the alignment you think you do! The good news is that a lot of techniques you can use to detect a [[Drunk]] will also work for a Marionette. If your information isn't adding up, or your ability doesn't work when it really should, you could actually be the Marionette instead of a good player!

- Even though you don't know it, your alignment is evil and you will register as evil to characters like the [[Seamstress]] and the [[Town Crier]]. You can use this to help determine your identity one way or another... but so can the town, so be careful about asking for players to use their abilities on you willy nilly!

- In most cases, the evil team is going to want to let you know that you should be working with them. If one of your neighbours tells you that you're a Marionette, take it seriously; while there's every possibility they're lying to you, they could also just be clueing you into your true identity, and if you out them and evil loses, you will lose along with them!

- If you suspect you are a Marionette (either through your information being confusing or someone straight up telling you), then don't tell other Townsfolk you suspect that! If you're right and the town believes you, the good team will know the Demon must be one of your neighbours.

- Avoid nominating or voting for your neighbours unless the evidence is especially compelling. If you are a Marionette, the Demon must be one of your neighbours. Accidentally executing your Demon because you didn't know you were evil will be a bit of a bummer!

- Narrow down which types of Minions are in play. The Marionette is by nature a secretive, invisible sort of Minion, while other Minions on the script might have more of a tell - confirming one of them also means confirming there isn't a Marionette to worry about. If you are in an 8 player game (1 Minion) and have just witnessed a [[Witch]] death, you're not the Marionette!

- If you are confident you know who the Minions are, you can also be confident you are not secretly the Marionette. There are only a limited number of Minions in the game, so even if you don't know what kind of Minion they are, confirming who the Minion IS will tell all other good players they are not a Marionette.

- Hunt down the Demon with gusto! If you are a Marionette, the Demon is one of your neighbours. If you can prove the Demon is sitting somewhere else (for example, a [[Fortune Teller]] ping on the other side of town), then you know you cannot be the Marionette! (Additionally if you ARE the Marionette, you point suspicion away from your Demon! Win-Win!)

- If you are concerned you are a Marionette but can't get your neighbours to open up, you can always try convincing your neighbours that they're your Marionette instead. Evil players will know this isn't true, while good players have to contend with whether you're telling the truth or not and will behave differently. This can give you a clue as to who your secretly evil allies are... or secretly evil neighbours, anyway.

- If you are convinced you are the Marionette, then you know your role is to protect your Demon. The town also knows the Marionette is a possibility, and will be on the lookout for tells you exist so that they can use you to take down your Demon. To keep town from suspecting you, change up your information so that it appears to be true instead - for example, if you believe you are a [[Savant]], makesure one statement is true and one is false each day.

- If you are a Demon, the Marionette is a responsibility you will have to decide how to interact with. It's absolutely beneficial to tell a Marionette their identity as soon as possible - this enables them to act to their true alignment, protect you, and not accidentally reveal you to the town when their ability malfunctions. It can also be useful to keep a Marionette in the dark - sometimes the most potent evil player is someone who is earnestly good! If your Marionette has won over the town, let them lead the charge (away from you). They'll still win in the end, just not for the reasons they thought!

- If you are a Demon, nothing is stopping you telling your actually good neighbours that they are your Marionette. In fact, you can tell both of them, reassuring each that they are the 'real' Marionette and that the other is being duped! Since a Marionette doesn't know their true alignment, it will always be to these players' benefits to keep your claim secret and figure out for themselves if they are on your team or not - a process that will take some time and make them behave in ways counterproductive to the good team in the meanwhile. Just beware their wrath if they manage to figure it out - they will most certainly turn around and execute you, so make sure you have an exit plan!

- If you are a Minion, tell your good neighbours that they are your Marionette! You get all the benefits of confusing the good team with none of the danger of losing the game by execution if or when you are discovered as a fraud!

- Are you good, but have an uncooperative neighbour? Tell them that they're your Marionette! For a while at least, most players will work with you while unravelling their own identity, and you can utilise this trick to get them to share information and participate in plots with you that they otherwise wouldn't. Just make sure to come clean before the end so they know they have to work with the good team to win.


## Fighting the Marionette
- In the same way that you might look for the [[Drunk]] in [[Trouble Brewing]], look for a player that is giving false information, even convincingly so. If a particular player's information doesn't add up, you may have found the Marionette. For example, if a player claims to be the [[Empath]] and that they got a "0", but you suspect that one of their neighbours is evil, the [[Empath]] may be the Marionette.

- If a player claims to be the Demon, and that you are the Marionette, you've got a problem. Are you the Marionette? Maybe not. If you think that the player is in fact the Demon, and that a Marionette is in play, talk to the Demon's other neighbouring player and see if you can figure out if they are the Marionette instead! If you think that the player who told you that you are the Marionette is not the Demon, then they are almost certainly a Minion instead. Either way, you've found an evil player (or a good player that needs to stop lying to you). If you have been told that you are the Marionette, but you figure out that you are not the Marionette, you've basically won the game.

- If you are confident that you are not the Marionette, but you've been told that you are the Marionette, tell the group this. The group will likely execute your neighbour, which means either a dead Demon, a dead Minion, or a dead good player that made a bluff that wasn't helping much or was just trolling.

- Find out how many players have been told that they are the Marionette. If there is more than one, it is unlikely that a Marionette is in play at all.

- Pay attention to your neighbours. If you think that neither is the Demon, and neither have told you that you are the Marionette, you can probably just ignore the fact that a Marionette is in the game. As long as you keep your neighbours alive on the final day, the fact that a Marionette is in play isn't too much of a worry. Default to finding out which players are good, and which player is the Demon.

- If the Marionette is on the script, don't execute your own neighbours. You never can be too sure. Execute all other players instead, if you can.

- If you think the Marionette is in play, but that it isn't you, you know something very important - that the Demon and the Minion are sitting next to each other. Just as if you were the [[Chef]] or the [[Clockmaker]], you have some very useful information to go on. Assume that two evil players are sitting next to each other, and see if this matches with the other information in the game. If it matches up, you've probably found out who the evil pair is. If it doesn't match up, there probably isn't a Marionette in play. Either way, you and all other good players know something useful.

- Normally, finding out that a player is a Minion is handy, but won't win the game for the good team. On the final day, learning that a long-dead player was actually the [[Mastermind]] is handy, but finding out that long-dead player was actually the Marionette is amazingly helpful. Even if a [[Pit-Hag]] has been changing characters willy nilly, or a [[Pukka]] has been making everyone's information dubious, the single piece of information - that a particular player is the Marionette - should be enough to win the game for the good team when just 3 players are left alive.

- Pay attention to players that were very vocal and enthusiastic about sharing information and helping the good team for a few days, then all of a sudden went silent. They may have been told that they are the Marionette in the middle of the game, and had a complete mental breakdown ;)
