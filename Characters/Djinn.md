# "Use the Djinn's special rule. All players know what it is."

## Summary
Add the Djinn to all games with a jinx icon on the script. The Djinn resolves jinxes by creating a unique rule.

- When creating a character list using the Script Tool, some character combinations will be marked as unusual. These two characters are jinxed—they have abilities that clash or contradict each other in some way. The Djinn creates a special rule that allows these characters to work well together. Some jinxed characters even work better with the Djinn in play!
- The Djinn’s special rule is described by the Script Tool online, and is printed out automatically when you create a script with a character combination that is jinxed.
- There are many different Djinn special rules. Each is tailored to a specific pair of jinxed characters.
- If there are jinxed characters on the character sheet, even if there are no jinxed characters in play, the Storyteller tells all players what the Djinn’s special rule is at the start of the game.
- The Djinn may have several special rules at once. If there are multiple pairs of jinxed characters on the character sheet, the players learn all the Djinn’s special rules.
## How to Run
At the start of the game, if there are jinxed characters on the character sheet, declare that the Djinn is in play and inform the group of all Djinn special rules for this game. (_Do this even if there are no jinxed characters in play._)

Follow the Djinn instructions as listed on the Script Tool printout.
### Examples
>The [[Pit-Hag]] and the [[Heretic]] are Jinxed. At the start of the game, the Storyteller reads out the Djinn's special rule: “A [[Pit-Hag]] cannot create a [[Heretic]].” Later in the game, the [[Pit-Hag]] tries to create a [[Heretic]]. The Storyteller shakes their head, and the [[Pit-Hag]] must choose another character to create.

>The [[Spy]] and the [[Magician]] are Jinxed. At the start of the game, the Storyteller reads out the Djinn's special rule: "When the [[Spy]] sees the grimoire, the Demon and the [[Magician]]'s character tokens are removed." There is no [[Spy]] and no [[Magician]] in play, but the Storyteller reads this aloud anyway so that the good team doesn't know which Minion is in play.

## Examples
When creating a character list using the Script Tool, some character combinations will be marked as unusual with a little character symbol under one of the characters you have selected. These two characters are Jinxed—they have abilities that clash or contradict each other in some way. The Djinn creates a special rule that allows these characters to work well together. Some jinxed characters even work _better_ with the Djinn in play!

The Djinn's special rule is described by the Script Tool online, and is printed out automatically when you create a script with a character combination that is jinxed. There are many different Djinn special rules. Each is tailored to a specific pair of jinxed characters. If there are jinxed characters on the character sheet, even if there are no jinxed characters in play, the Storyteller tells all players what the Djinn's special rule is at the start of the game.

The Djinn may have several special rules at once. If there are multiple pairs of jinxed characters on the character sheet, the players learn all the Djinn's special rules.

## Djinn Special Rules

Special rules for characters from Trouble Brewing, Sects & Violets, and Bad Moon Rising:

- [[Fang Gu]] and [[Scarlet Woman]]: If the [[Fang Gu]] chooses an outsider and dies, the [[Scarlet Woman]] does not become the [[Fang Gu]].

- [[Chambermaid]] and [[Mathematician]]: The [[Chambermaid]] learns if the [[Mathematician]] wakes tonight or not, even though the [[Chambermaid]] wakes first.

- [[Lunatic]] and [[Mathematician]]: The [[Mathematician]] learns if the [[Lunatic]] attacks a different player(s) than the real Demon attacks.

Special rules involving Experimental characters:

- Many pairs of characters follow the "hate" jinx special rule of: "Only one jinxed character can be in play". Currently, these character pairs are:
    - [[Godfather]] and [[Heretic]]
    - [[Spy]] and [[Damsel]]
    - [[Spy]] and [[Heretic]]
    - [[Widow]] and [[Damsel]]
    - [[Widow]] and [[Heretic]]
    - [[Legion]] and [[Preacher]]
    - [[Lil' Monsta]] and [[Magician]]
    - [[Riot]] and [[Exorcist]]
    - [[Riot]] and [[Flowergirl]]
    - [[Riot]] and [[Minstrel]]
    - [[Al-Hadikhia]] and [[Mastermind]], with the additional rule that evil players start knowing which player and character it is.
    - [[Organ Grinder]] and [[Minstrel]], with the additional rule that evil players start knowing which player and character it is.
    - [[Organ Grinder]] and [[Preacher]], with the additional rule that evil players start knowing which player and character it is.
    - [[Vizier]] and [[Magician]], with the additional rule that evil players start knowing which player and character it is.

- Some pairs of characters cannot be in play in the start of the game, or have special rules relating to their creation:
    - [[Pit-Hag]] and [[Damsel]]: If a [[Pit-Hag]] creates a [[Damsel]], the Storyteller chooses which player it is.
    - [[Pit-Hag]] and [[Heretic]]: A [[Pit-Hag]] cannot create a [[Heretic]].
    - [[Pit-Hag]] and [[Politician]]: A [[Pit-Hag]] cannot create an evil [[Politician]].
    - [[Pit-Hag]] and [[Riot]]: If the [[Pit-Hag]] creates [[Riot]], all evil players become [[Riot]]. If the [[Pit-Hag]] creates [[Riot]] after day 3, the game continues for one more day.
    - [[Legion]] and [[Engineer]]: [[Legion]] and the [[Engineer]] cannot both be in play at the start of the game. If the [[Engineer]] creates [[Legion]], most players (including all evil players) become evil [[Legion]].
    - [[Engineer]] and [[Riot]]: [[Riot]] and the [[Engineer]] cannot both be in play at the start of the game. If the [[Engineer]] creates [[Riot]], the evil players become [[Riot]].

- Several experimental townsfolk characters ([[Alchemist]], [[Magician]], [[Poppy Grower]]) interact poorly with Minion characters ([[Spy]] and [[Widow]]) that get to see the Grimoire. The jinxes between these characters are:
    - [[Alchemist]]: The [[Alchemist]] cannot have the [[Spy]]/[[Widow]] ability.
    - [[Magician]]: When the [[Spy]]/[[Widow]] sees the Grimoire, the Demon and the [[Magician]]'s character tokens are removed.
    - [[Poppy Grower]]: If the [[Poppy Grower]] is in play, the [[Spy]]/[[Widow]] does not see the Grimoire until the [[Poppy Grower]] dies.

- Other jinxes between experimental townsfolk and good characters are:
    - [[Lycanthrope]] and [[Gambler]]: If the [[Lycanthrope]] is alive and the [[Gambler]] kills themselves at night, no other players can die tonight.
    - [[Cannibal]] and [[Butler]]: If the [[Cannibal]] gains the [[Butler]] ability, the [[Cannibal]] learns this.

This section will get updated as more characters are made available.

The Djinn special rule allows Jinxed characters to both be on the same script, and even both in play at the same time. If your script has jinxed characters, let your players know the Djinn special rule(s) at the beginning of the game, whether or not Jinxed characters are in play.
