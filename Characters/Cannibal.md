# "You have the ability of the recently killed executee. If they are evil, you are poisoned until a good player dies by execution."

## Summary
The Cannibal eats executed characters, gaining their ability.

- If a good player dies by execution, the Cannibal gains that player’s ability. If an evil player dies by execution, the Cannibal only thinks that they gain an ability, since the Cannibal is poisoned. The Storyteller may be lying to them.
- Each time a player dies by execution, the Cannibal loses the ability of the previous player.
- Executing a dead player won’t grant the Cannibal an ability. Executing a living player who doesn’t die won’t grant the Cannibal an ability. A player must be executed and die for the Cannibal to gain their ability.
- The Cannibal is not told which ability they have gained. They must figure that out for themselves.
- If the Cannibal has an “even if dead” ability, such as the Recluse, or an ability that implies it works while dead, such as the Ravenkeeper or Sweetheart, the Cannibal keeps that ability when they die, but loses their Cannibal ability.

## How to Run
If a good player dies by execution, mark them with the **DIED TODAY** reminder, and remove the Cannibal’s **POISONED** reminder if necessary. The Cannibal now has this good player’s ability (_do not say which_), and will wake at night when this good character would normally wake.

If an evil player dies by execution, mark them with the **DIED TODAY** reminder and mark the Cannibal with the **POISONED** reminder. The Cannibal is poisoned. You may wake them when this evil character would normally wake, and pretend that they have a new ability.

>Pay attention to which character each evil player is bluffing as. If they are executed, then their bluffed ability is the best one to pretend that the Cannibal has gained.
### Examples
>The [[Clockmaker]] is executed and dies. That night, the Cannibal learns a “2” because the Demon and Minion are two steps apart.

>It is the third night and the [[Widow]] was executed today. Because the [[Widow]] was bluffing as the [[Fortune Teller]], the Cannibal is prompted to choose 2 players, but they learn a “no” after choosing the Demon because they don’t actually have the [[Fortune Teller]]'s (or [[Widow]]’s) ability, because they are poisoned.

>It is the fourth night and the [[Mutant]] was executed today. The Cannibal doesn’t learn anything tonight, because a real [[Mutant]] would not wake.

## Discord How to Run
If a player dies by execution mark them with the “Died today” reminder. 
If they are good, the Cannibal now has that ability and loses their previously gained ability. Wake them when that character usually wakes or otherwise treat them as if they were that character. 
If they are evil, the Cannibal should be marked with the “Poisoned” reminder and you can pretend that they have a poisoned version of any ability – it’s recommended to pretend they have the ability of the character the executed evil player was bluffing. 

Executing a dead player won’t grant the Cannibal an ability. Executing a living player who doesn’t die, won’t grant the Cannibal an ability. A player must be executed and die for the Cannibal to gain their ability. 

If a Cannibal gains a “start knowing” ability, they get that “start knowing” information that night after the poisoners and Demons have acted. The Cannibal is not told which ability they have gained. They must figure that out for themselves.

If a Cannibal has gained an ability and no-one is executed the following day(s) the Cannibal keeps that ability until someone else is executed. 

If the Cannibal has an “even if dead” ability, such as the [[Recluse]], or an ability that implies it works while dead, such as the [[Ravenkeeper]] or [[Sweetheart]], the [[Cannibal]] keeps that ability when they die (but loses their Cannibal ability). 

If a Cannibal gains an ability that includes [setup square brackets] this section of the ability does not happen as abilities in square brackets only happen at setup, not mid-game.

## Interesting Interactions
- [[Chambermaid]]: If a [[Chambermaid]] chooses a Cannibal that is waking due to having gained a night-waking ability, they register as waking to the [[Chambermaid]]. The ability that Cannibal has gained is still the Cannibal’s own, despite having been copied from the recent executee. 
- [[Courtier]]: If the [[Courtier]] chooses the character whose ability the Cannibal has, the Cannibal is not poisoned as they are the Cannibal, not the character whose ability they currently have. 
- [[Cult Leader]]/[[Goon]]: Gaining these abilities can allow the Cannibal to change alignments and if another non-alignment changing player is executed before they change back again, the Cannibal can be locked in as their changed alignment.
- [[Dreamer]]/[[Gambler]]/[[Grandmother]]/[[Ravenkeeper]]/[[Undertaker]] etc: the Cannibal is always the Cannibal, regardless of the abilities they may have gained and would be shown to these character checkers as the Cannibal as a result. 
- [[Gossip]]: If you have a Cannibal and a living [[Gossip]], it’s worth also keeping an eye on the Cannibal’s [[Gossip]] statements. If the [[Gossip]] is executed that day, the Cannibal’s [[Gossip]] statement can cause a kill that night if true as the Cannibal will have the [[Gossip]] ability at the point that the [[Gossip]] ability is evaluated. 
- [[Juggler]]: if the [[Juggler]] is executed, the Cannibal can only take advantage of the [[Juggler]] ability if no-one is executed the following day. The day after the [[Juggler]] is executed would be the CanniJuggler’s “1st day” so they would have to juggle that day and ensure no-one (or a dead/protected player) is executed in order for them to maintain their ability to find out the results of their juggle the following night. 
- [[Mathematician]]: If a Cannibal is poisoned by an evil player being executed, it’s the Cannibal’s _own_ ability that is poisoning them, so the [[Mathematician]] does not register this as a malfunction. 
- [[Snake Charmer]]: If the Snake Charmer is executed and the good Cannibal picks the evil Demon, the Cannibal becomes an evil Demon and the Demon becomes a good poisoned Cannibal. As it stands, based on the Philo-[[Snake Charmer]] ruling, the ex-Demon-now-Cannibal is poisoned. 
- [[Butler]]: If the Cannibal gains the [[Butler]] ability they learn this. (Otherwise they could break the [[Butler]] rules re voting without realising). 
- [[Drunk]]: If the [[Drunk]] is executed, you can deceive the Cannibal that they are any Townsfolk, including the one [[Drunk]] thought they were. 
- [[Lunatic]]: If a [[Lunatic]] is executed, you should tell the Cannibal they are now one of the Demons on the script (confirm they are still good), take the corresponding kill choices and inform the Demon that the Cannibal player is their [[Lunatic]] and who they chose. If the Cannibal asks what character they are at any point while they have the [[Lunatic]] ability, you should confirm that they are the Demon you told them they were. If they lose the [[Lunatic]] ability through a further execution, continue to treat them exactly as you would have done had that execution occurred without a [[Lunatic]] execution beforehand, do not tell them they are no longer a Demon etc. If they then ask what character they are, you can confirm to them they are the Cannibal, but should not confirm anything about why you told them they are a Demon. 
- [[Mutant]]: If a Cannibal has the [[Mutant]] ability, they can claim to be a Cannibal with the [[Mutant]] ability and cannot be executed as they are not claiming to be an Outsider. If they claim to _be_ the [[Mutant]], however, they might be executed. 
- [[Politician]]: If a Cannibal has the [[Politician]] ability, they are in competition with the actual now-dead [[Politician]] as only one player can be _most_ responsible for their team losing, so only one can change alignment and win. 
- [[Recluse]]: The Storyteller can _either_ register the [[Recluse]] as evil to the Cannibal and make them poisoned, pretending they have another ability _or_ give the Cannibal the [[Recluse]] ability and register them as evil&Minion/Demon to other abilities, not both. 
- [[Snitch]]: If the Cannibal gains the [[Snitch]] ability the Minions are woken that night and given three out-of-play characters which may or may not be the same ones they or the Demon received previously. 
- [[Cerenovus]]: If a player is [[Cerenovus]]-mad about being a certain character, they cannot claim to be a Cannibal with the ability of that character and expect to be safe from [[Cerenovus]]-madness-breaking execution as they are not claiming to actually _be_ that character, which is the [[Cerenovus]] requirement. 
- [[Spy]]: I know I’m disappointing people here, but a Cannibal cannot legitimately be treated as sober/healthy and having gained the [[Spy]] ability without having a legitimately good [[Spy]] already. The [[Spy]] specifically registers as good _**and**_ as a Townsfolk or Outsider, so if the Spy registers as good to the Cannibal, they must also register as a specific Townsfolk/Outsider and the Cannibal would gain that ability instead. Having said all of that, if you register the [[Spy]] as evil, the Cannibal is poisoned and you can technically deceive them about anything, including showing them an accurate grimoire if you really really insist, but at that point you’re just trying to do what you want regardless of what’s sane/reasonable/fun, so I’mma leave you to it. 
- [[Professor]]/[[Shabaloth]]: When the Cannibal is resurrected, they are brought back to life and immediately gain the ability of the recently killed executee – so if, for example, the [[Chambermaid]] is executed and dies, then the [[Professor]] resurrects the Cannibal that night, the Cannibal will wake the same night to use the [[Chambermaid]] ability, even though the Cannibal was dead when the [[Chambermaid]] was executed. 
- [[Vortox]]: Everyone ready for a niche situation? If the [[Snitch]] is executed in a [[Vortox]] game, the Cannibal gains the [[Snitch]] ability. Technically it’s the Cannibal version of the [[Snitch]] ability that is giving information to the Minions, so with the new version of [[Vortox]] being that _Townsfolk_ abilities give false information, the Minions would each be told three _in_ play characters due to the Cannibal-[[Snitch]] ability being a Townsfolk ability rather than an Outsider ability. Similarly the Cannibal-[[Lunatic]] would tell the [[Vortox]] that a different player is the [[Lunatic]] and different players were attacked. 
- [[Zombuul]]: Counts as dying by execution for almost all purposes, including the Cannibal ability, so the Cannibal would be poisoned.

## Tips and Tricks
- Execute people! While it is not advantageous to execute good players, your ability reduces the sting of this by quite a lot. Even if the town executes a Townsfolk by accident, the fact that you can still pick up their ability should help the good team significantly.

- Keep a special eye out for players claiming to be Townsfolk with once-per-game abilities. You can eat such Townsfolk, use their once-per-game power, and keep chewing on more Townsfolk as the game goes on.

- Remember you're not told which ability you have at any time! You may be able to figure it out based on things happening at night - being woken up and asked to choose two players means you're probably the [[Fortune Teller]] or the [[Chambermaid]] for example, but you can't necessarily be sure which.

- Be sure to talk to executees before they die if you can, in the hopes that you can learn what exact ability you’re going to be picking up from them. If their ability is something that can only be used during the day, for example a [[Slayer]], you may miss the opportunity to use such an ability if you don’t know you have it.

- Alternatively, don’t talk to the executed and then approach them the following day and describe what you experienced in the night, thus confirming to them that you are the Cannibal. This will help you build a circle of trust amongst the executed dead.

- Don’t forget that evil players might give you fake abilities when executed. Your Storyteller will generally still try to make you think you have the ability the evil player claimed they had.

## Bluffing
When bluffing as the Cannibal, there are a few things you should keep in mind:

- Try to get people executed! It’s what a real Cannibal would do, and it’s a great excuse to go after Townsfolk. Even if the town later discovers they killed someone useful on your suggestion, they may still hold hope you can recoup such a loss with cannibalism, a hope you would be more than happy to fill with a lie.

- If you want to accuse an executee of being evil, consider acting like your power didn’t work after you ate them. Evil players poison the Cannibal when eaten, giving you lots of bluffing possibilities no matter what you say.

- Be ready to fake a new ability every time someone is executed, that may mean interviewing executees before they die or conspiring with your allies. If you claim to eat someone who gets information every night, but don’t claim to have gotten information the night of their execution, you might be in a pickle. Unless, of course, you say such an absence of information was merely due to the fact that they were evil and poisoned you! But that mileage may vary.
