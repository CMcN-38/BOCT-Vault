# "All Minions know you are in play. If a Minion publicly guesses you (once), your team loses."

## Summary
The Damsel absolutely, positively cannot be found out by the evil team.

- If a Minion guesses that you are the Damsel, and does so publicly (_so that all players know that they are a Minion_), evil wins.
- No matter how many Minions are in play, they only get one guess, total. If a Minion makes a guess and is wrong, future guesses by this Minion or by other Minions don’t count.
- If the Demon pretends to be a Minion making a guess, that doesn’t count as a guess. Minions may still make a guess and win.
- Minions may make a guess at any time.
- If the Damsel dies, they are no longer at risk of being guessed by a Minion, since the Damsel loses their ability when dead.
- There may not be a Huntsman in play. But if there is, and the Huntsman chooses the Damsel at night, the Damsel becomes a not-in-play Townsfolk, and is no longer the Damsel. The Damsel learns which Townsfolk and has that Townsfolk ability from then on.
## How to Run
During the first night, wake each Minion. Show the Damsel token. Put each Minion to sleep.

At any time during the game, if a Minion publicly guesses which player is the Damsel and is incorrect, mark the Damsel with the **GUESS USED** reminder. Future guesses by Minion players have no effect.

At any time during the game, if a Minion publicly guesses which player is the Damsel and is correct, the game ends. Declare that the evil team wins.
### Examples
>Marianna is the Damsel. She is bluffing as the [[Lycanthrope]]. The [[Witch]] guesses that Marianna is the Damsel. Evil wins.

>Doug is the Damsel. The [Poisoner](https://wiki.bloodontheclocktower.com/Poisoner) guesses that Julian is the Damsel. The game continues. The [Goblin](https://wiki.bloodontheclocktower.com/Goblin) guesses that Doug is the Damsel. The game continues because the [Poisoner](https://wiki.bloodontheclocktower.com/Poisoner) has used up the one guess the Minions share.

## Discord How to Run
During the first night, wake all Minions and show the Damsel token, then put the Minions to sleep. Do not show them who the Damsel is! If, at any point, a Minion publicly guesses which living player is the Damsel and is correct, the game ends and evil wins. If the guess is incorrect, place the “Guess used” reminder by the Damsel. All future Minion guesses have no effect. Note that this means that all Minions have one guess between them, not one guess per Minion. The Demon does not get a guess. Minions may guess at any time, day or night, alive or dead. Much like the Slayer, in order to “publicly guess” the Damsel, the Minion must announce to the whole group something along the lines of “I guess that player X is the Damsel”. Picking the Damsel with a Minion ability is not equivalent to “publicly guessing” them. 

If the Damsel is dead, they have no ability and are therefore no longer at risk of being guessed by a Minion. Similarly, if the Damsel is drunk or poisoned, a correct guess does not end the game but the one guess is still used up if made during this time. If the Damsel is made poisoned or drunk on the first night, the Minions would already have been told that the Damsel is in play, so this is not affected. If a Damsel comes into play later in the game, the Minions would be told at the first opportunity if the Damsel player is sober/healthy at the time, or at the first point they’re sober/healthy if not. 

Note that the Damsel does have a night order place, but this is not when the info regarding it being in play is given to the Minions: that should be done along with Minion info. The Damsel place in the night order is to remind the ST to wake the Damsel if the Huntsman blind-picks them on N1 or picks them more consciously on future nights. As a result, as mentioned above, the Damsel info cannot be prevented from going out to the Minions on N1 by drunkenness or poisoning. 

If town attempts to force every player to make a Damsel guess in order to waste the Minion guess, the ST should ignore any Minion guesses that were forced by peer pressure or otherwise.

## Interesting Interactions
- [[Cannibal]]: If the Damsel is executed and the [[Cannibal]] gets their ability, the Minions can successfully guess the [[Cannibal]] and win the game. 
- [[Chambermaid]]: Minions learning the Damsel is in play are not waking due to their own ability, so do not register to the [[Chambermaid]] on night 1. 
- [[Magician]]: Is not actually a Minion so is not informed about the Damsel, nor will them “guessing” the Damsel have any effect. 
- [[Monk]]: Protects against the Demon, not Minions, and only at night, so [[Monk]] protection would not prevent a correct Minion guess of a Damsel ending the game. Except for (niche issue time), a LM-holding Minion that guesses the Damsel at night while the Damsel is [[Monk]]-protected, I would rule that the game doesn’t end in that scenario. 
- [[Poppy Grower]]: Minions still all learn if there is a Damsel in play, even if they don’t know who each other are. 
- [[Preacher]]: A Preached Minion is still a Minion even though they don’t have their ability, so can successfully guess the Damsel. 
- [[Barber]]: If the Damsel is swapped, you do not need to reinform the Minions that the Damsel is in play even though the ability has re-entered play, they continue to know from being informed previously. If a player is swapped into having a Minion character and weren’t one previously, they are, however, told that the Damsel is in play. This can result in a very bad day for the evil team if the Damsel is swapped with a Minion, as the good ex-Damsel-now-Minion knows somewhere there is an evil Damsel and, based on whether they are told that a Damsel is in play, would know whether the evil now-Damsel is alive or not and whether they can therefore be guessed to win the game. 
- [[Goon]]: A Minion guessing that the [[Goon]] is the Damsel will not affect the [[Goon]]’s alignment – the Minion is not choosing the [[Goon]] with their ability. 
- [[Recluse]]: Can guess the Damsel, register as a Minion, and end the game. Probably best not to guess if you’re the [[Recluse]]! Technically you can tell the Recluse that there is a Damsel in play by registering them as a Minion at the relevant time, but it’s generally not the point of Outsiders that they can be hard-confirmed to other players, so I wouldn’t. 
- [[Evil Twin]]: Don’t make the Damsel the good Twin, that’ll end the game day 1… 
- [[Marionette]]: If the [[Marionette]] thinks they are the Damsel, the other Minions are not told that the Damsel is in play. [[Marionette]]/Damsel jinx - “The Marionette does not learn there is a Damsel in play.” 
- [[Pit-Hag]]: Jinxed - "If a [[Pit-Hag]] creates a Damsel, the Storyteller chooses which player it is." When the Damsel is created, all Minions learn immediately there is a Damsel in play if the Damsel player is alive. If an evil Damsel is created, the evil team loses if a Minion guesses them. If there was a Damsel in play, a Minion makes an incorrect Damsel guess, the Damsel is removed and then a new Damsel comes into play, the Minions can guess again. 
- [[Scarlet Woman]]/[[Imp]]: If the Demon has died and the SW/a Minion has become the Demon, they cannot guess the Damsel. 
- [[Spy]]/[[Widow]]: Jinxed - "Only 1 jinxed character can be in play." 
- [[Witch]]: Even if only 3 players live and they have lost their ability, can still guess the Damsel. 
- [[Legion]]: A [[Legion]] can guess the Damsel by registering as a Minion. 
- [[Lil Monsta]]: All Minions, including the one who is babysitting and therefore _also_ registering as the Demon, learns the Damsel is in play and can guess them. 
- [[Shabaloth]]: If a Damsel is resurrected, the Minions are similarly not reinformed that a Damsel is in play, their being told at the start of the game is sufficient. If there is a new Minion who has not previously been informed, however, they would be informed. Accordingly, it’s best to not resurrect a Damsel using the [[Shabaloth]]. If guesses have been made previous to the Damsel resurrection, they do not count for this new instance of the Damsel ability, so the Minions have one more opportunity to guess the Damsel. 
- [[Apprentice]]: Cannot guess the Damsel even if evil as they are not a Minion, they just have a Minion ability. 
- [[Barista]]: If [[Barista]] doubled when no guess has been made, 2 guesses can be made by Minions today. If a guess has already been made, one more guess can be made today. However, as it would be the Damsel that would be told they were [[Barista]] doubled, the Minions wouldn’t know they would get an extra opportunity to guess unless the Damsel announced it. 
- [[Bone Collector]]: See [[Shabaloth]]. 
- [[Revolutionary]]: Technically the “registers falsely” could allow you to register a good player as a Minion when they accuse someone of being the Damsel or for a Damsel to register as something else when guessed… Don’t be a douchecanoe. 
- [[Storm Catcher]]: Don’t pick the Damsel. Seriously. Don’t.

## Tips and Tricks
- Don't tell anyone that you are the Damsel! Don't even hint that you might be! If an evil player believes that you are the Damsel, then correctly guesses that you are the Damsel, the evil team wins.

- Tell one or two trusted players that you are the Damsel, so that the group doesn't put too much pressure on you to reveal who you are. You'll want to make very sure that these one or two players are good before telling them though. Characters that can confirm that they are good, such as the [[Virgin]] or [[Slayer]] are particularly useful, since you can sometimes trust them completely. Even characters that can almost prove that they are good, such as the [[Undertaker]], [[Washerwoman]], or [[Juggler]] are worth talking to, trusting, and telling who you are.

- Bluff as a Townsfolk, not an Outsider. All players know how many Outsiders are in play. All Minions know that a Damsel is in play. Minions will tend to be more suspicious of players claiming to be Outsiders if the number of claimed Outsiders equals the numbers of Outsiders in play. For example, if there is only meant to be one Outsider in play, and they know that there is a Damsel, and there is one player claiming to be the [[Sweetheart]], then the [[Sweetheart]] is probably the Damsel.

- The Minions know you're in play. Be attentive to which players are watching and listening more than usual.

- Avoid bluffing at all if the town is also fairly silent about their characters. If most other players have not revealed who they are, being silent means that you'll look like just another Townsfolk. Minions will need to choose randomly to guess correctly, and that's probably far too risky for them.

- If you are a good character that isn't the Damsel, but the Damsel is on the script, be aware that is a great reason for good players to lie and act suspicious. Treat other players with less suspicion, put less pressure on them to reveal who they are (even when they have been nominated), and generally cut the good team some slack. Assuming that a Damsel is in play, even when nobody has claimed to be the Damsel, means that the real Damsel has some cover.

- If you are a good character that isn't the Damsel, pretend to be the Damsel and see if you can bait the Minion players into guessing that you are the Damsel. You'll probably only be convincing by spreading a rumour, not publicly claiming to be the Damsel, but you never know. If a Minion guesses that you are the Damsel, then the good team has found out who a Minion is, which is fantastic information. This strategy works even if there is a real Damsel in play too - in which case, the real Damsel can safely come out as the Damsel, since the Minions are only allowed one Damsel-guess per game.

- Boldly claim to be the Damsel who has already been chosen by the [[Huntsman]] and changed into a different character! If this were true, you would no longer be the Damsel, and therefore the Minions guessing that you are the Damsel will have no effect. Minions may not want to reveal who they are to risk a guess on a Damsel claiming to no longer be the Damsel. Be aware though... this strategy is very risky. Since you will really still be the Damsel, evil can still win by guessing that you are the Damsel, and they know who you are now.

- If you suspect there's a [[Huntsman]], make them your number one priority - if you transform into a townsfolk, you gain a cool ability, and you can't be named by the Minions anymore. The good team will be working to reunite you, while the evil team will be working to intercept, so tread carefully while you make the hunter the hunted!

- If a Minion has come out and guessed who the Damsel is but it wasn't you, congratulations! The evil team only gets one chance for a Minion to name you, and that part of your ability is now inert. Feel free to come out and gloat a little bit!

- If a Minion has come out and guessed who the Damsel is but it wasn't you, congratulations! However, maybe it's worth being wary - it could have been an evil Townsfolk or a Demon pretending to make the guess, exactly so you'll come out and gloat and then an actual Minion can use the guess on you and win the game through your own hubris...

- If you are killed (at night or by execution), you will no longer have an ability and can come out. Be wary about being too eager to get executed, though - Minions will be on the watch for that!

- You hold the fate of the game in your hands. Very few characters have this power. Remember how important you are. Much like the [[Heretic]], your ability can lose your team the game if the wrong people learn who you are at the wrong time. While you are alive, you are the most dangerous good player in the game (to your own team!).

## Bluffing
When bluffing as the Damsel, there are a few things you should keep in mind:

- The Damsel is a pretty dangerous character to be, since coming out to the wrong person at the wrong time could cost their entire team the game. If you're going to bluff as a Damsel, you need to embody that mindset - no Damsel would publicly come out to the group, for example. Play as if your ability will lose you the game (cautious, cagey, and openly lying), or the good team might smell that you are not as helpless as you seem!

- The Damsel is an advanced bluff compared to some due to its win/lose nature - both the good team and evil team are very incentivized to figure out who and where a Damsel is. Don't be discouraged though - while the good team will be paying extra attention to you, they can't easily call you out (because if they're wrong, they lose!) and if you manage to convince them? You're golden. A lot of risk for a lot of reward!

- Damsels will typically try to pick out a good player they trust to bring into the fold, and you can do the same. Find a good player you want to spend a lot of time worrying about you and a potential [[Huntsman]], and not your Demon and the rest of the evil team. By sharing your secret, you can easily create a bond of trust that will last at least for a few days, and hopefully keep that player working on you and your problem as opposed to the more pressure issue of who the Demon is!

- Coordinating with your evil team can lead to very effective Damsel bluffs. The most obvious option is to have one of you as the [[Huntsman]] and one of you as the Damsel. Once they 'find' you and successfully turn you, you both come out and both look good! If you're going to try this, make sure to let the good team do the hard work of reuniting you - if you come together without any real reason to do so, players may find you suspicious instead. Also be ready to abandon the bluff if your fellow evil player comes under fire - the Damsel can exist without a [[Huntsman]], and if you look like the victim of a devious Minion trap, all the better!

- If you can convince an evil teammate to fall on their sword, a triumphant Damsel coming out after the Minion has been tricked into guessing the wrong person is a great look. Not only will the good team be incredibly relieved that the Damsel's lose condition is off the table, but they'll be satisfied that an evil player has been outed! Be careful to time this well - a Minion making a Damsel guess will usually do so when they're either very certain or very desperate. Pull it off though, and you'll be believed good for the rest of the game!

- If you're going to pretend to have transformed, make sure to pick your new character carefully - doubling up with a good player will undo all your hard work so far since the [[Huntsman]] always transforms the Damsel into something not-in-play.

- If you're going to pretend to have transformed, deliberately double up with another good player and accuse them of lying about their ability! The Damsel cannot become an in-play character, so if the town believes you, the other person must be lying. :)

- If your first good bluff is falling apart, use the Damsel as a fallback - similar to the [[Mutant]], good players will probably back off if they think the reason you lied was to cover up your Outsider identity, rather than the fact you are evil. Everyone knows the Damsel is a potential problem, so some pointed eye contact and whispers should hopefully get your point across!

- Try to get an evil player who's not a Minion to publicly guess someone as the Damsel. This may convince the Damsel that the Minions have used their one guess for the game and so they may reveal themselves publicly - allowing a real Minion to then guess the real Damsel and win. Be very careful here - in most games, the only evil players who aren't Minions will be the demon, so it's a risky strategy to pull off as it will often require the demon claiming to be an evil role. But if you have a good player who's turned Evil - perhaps the [[Goon]], or a player turned evil by the [[Mezepheles]] or [[Bounty Hunter]] - they can serve this role admirably. Just make sure the evil player bluffing as the Minion doesn't pick the *actual* Damsel, as the Damsel will then be wise to their ruse when the game doesn't end.
