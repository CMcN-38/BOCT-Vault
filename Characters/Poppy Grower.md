# "Minions & Demons do not know each other. If you die, they learn who each other are that night."

## Summary
The Poppy Grower prevents the evil players from learning who each other are.

- The Demon still learns three not-in-play characters that are safe to bluff as.
- If the Poppy Grower dies, the Demon and Minions learn who each other are, as though it were the first night again.
- If the Poppy Grower becomes drunk or poisoned, Demons and Minions do not suddenly learn who each other are. If the Poppy Grower is drunk or poisoned when they die, Demons and Minions do not learn who each other are, since the Poppy Grower has no ability that night.
- An evil Traveller still learns which player is the Demon when that Traveller enters play.
## How to Run
During the first night, wake the Demon. Show the **THESE CHARACTERS ARE NOT IN PLAY** info token, then any three good character tokens that are not in play. Then, put the Demon to sleep. Do not do the Minion Info and Demon Info steps.

If the Poppy Grower dies, mark them with the **EVIL WAKES** reminder. That night, wake the Minions and let them make eye contact. Show the **THIS IS THE DEMON** info token, then point to the Demon. Put the Minions to sleep. Wake the Demon. Show the **THESE ARE YOUR MINIONS** info token, then point to the Minions. Put the Demon to sleep.
### Examples
>The [[Imp]], the [[Poisoner]] and the [[Witch]] are in play. On the first night, the [[Imp]] wakes to learn 3 not-in-play characters, but does not learn which players are the Minions. The [[Poisoner]] and the [[Witch]] do not wake to learn who each other are, and do not learn who the Demon is.

>The Poppy Grower is executed, and dies. That night, the [[Shabaloth]] learns which players are the Minions. The [[Godfather]] and the [[Baron]] wake, make eye contact, and learn which player is the [[Shabaloth]].

>The Poppy Grower is the Drunk. On the 1st night, the evil players learn who each other are, as normal. On the fourth night, the Demon kills the Poppy Grower. The Demons and Minions do not wake to learn who each other are again because the Poppy Grower is the Drunk.

## Discord How to Run
On the first night, do not wake the Minions during the Minion Info step. During the Demon Info step, show the Demon three not-in-play characters as normal, but do not show them who their Minions are. 

Later, if the Poppy Grower dies, place the “Evil wakes” reminder token, then at the first opportunity at night, wake the Demon and show them who their Minions are, then wake the Minions, show them who each other are and who the Demon is. This step is done regardless of whether the relevant players are alive or dead – they are still Minions or Demons respectively and therefore should be woken to learn each other. Note that all players whose current characters are Minions or Demons are woken to get information at this point, regardless of their original characters and their original or current alignments. If the Poppy Grower is drunk/poisoned on night 1 before the Minion/Demon info steps, the evil team learn who each other are as normal. If they are drunk/poisoned while still alive later in the game, nothing happens – evil do not learn each other. 

If the Poppy Grower is drunk/poisoned at the time they die – nothing happens, evil do not learn each other even when the Poppy Grower becomes sober/healthy. 

If a Minion or Demon is drunk/poisoned when the Poppy Grower dies, they are still told the other Minions/Demon, they still have the character type of Minion/Demon even though they have no ability. 

If an Evil Traveller enters the game, even on the first night, they learn who the Demon is as normal.

## Interesting Interactions
- [[Apprentice]]: As mentioned above, if Evil, still learns who the Demon is, even though they gain a Minion ability. An [[Apprentice]] Poppy Grower would cause the evil team to learn each other when they were either demon-killed or exiled as exile also results in death. 
- [[Barber]]/[[Pit-Hag]]/[[Snake Charmer]], all character changers: The players who have Minion or Demon characters when the Poppy Grower learn each other when the Poppy Grower dies, regardless of alignment, starting character or alive/dead status. 
- [[Barista]]: Dammit Jack. Technically a Poppy Grower who was [[Barista]] doubled the night they died would cause the evil team to be told each other twice. More realistically (and probably more entertainingly), you could [[Barista]] the Poppy Grower to be sober/healthy that night to make them think that they would otherwise have been drunk/poisoned and that you’re helping the evil team out. 
- [[Bone Collector]]: Has no effect if they pick Poppy Grower. Even if the PG is executed and the [[Bone Collector]] picks them that night, the evil team would have been told each other’s identities the instant night fell, before the [[Bone Collector]] uses their ability. 
- [[Bounty Hunter]]/[[Cult Leader]]/[[Goon]]/alignment switchers: The Evil townsfolk/evil [[Cult Leader]]/evil [[Goon]] is not a Minion so is not told who the evil team is when the Poppy Grower dies.
- [[Cannibal]]/[[Pixie]]: If the Poppy Grower is executed and consumed by the [[Cannibal]] or seen by the sufficiently-mad [[Pixie]], the Poppy Grower ability is in play the instant the Poppy Grower dies and prevents the evil team learning who each other are. If a [[Cannibal]] then consumes a new ability without dying, the evil team can never learn who each other are as the Poppy Grower ability requires them to actively die to give the evil team information. 
- [[Chambermaid]]: Minions/Demons woken when the Poppy Grower dies are waking due to the Poppy Grower ability and not their own, so do not register to the [[Chambermaid]]. 
- [[Evil Twin]]: The [[Evil Twin]] and their opposing player still know each other, this is unaffected by the Poppy Grower. 
- [[Legion]]: [[Legion]] players would not learn who the other [[Legion]] players were, but would need to be woken individually to give them their three out-of-play characters. 
- [[Lil’ Monsta]]: Has a jinx - "If the Poppy Grower is in play, Minions don't wake together. They are woken one by one, until one of them chooses to take the [[Lil' Monsta]] token." 
- [[Lunatic]]: You can choose to pretend to the [[Lunatic]] that there is a Poppy Grower in play even if there isn’t (if it is on the script), thereby not telling them who their “Minions” are on the first night. 
- [[Mathematician]]: Does not register for the Demon/Minions not learning each other as they do not gain this info through their abilities, but through their character types. It would, however, register a Poppy Grower that was poisoned/drunk when they died and therefore did not allow the Demon/Minions to learn each other. 
- [[Philosopher]]: If the Philosopher chooses Poppy Grower, when the [[Philosopher]] dies, the Poppy Grower ability that is healthy as of the moment the [[Philosopher]] dies prevents the Philoppygrower ability from causing the Demon/Minions to learn who each other are. This would, however, create a [[Mathematician]] ping because the Philoppygrower ability did not function correctly due to the Poppy Grower ability – these are different characters hence the ping. 
- [[Pit-Hag]]: A Poppy Grower turned into another character would not cause the Minions/Demon to learn each other. 
- [[Preacher]]: Preached Minions still learn info when the Poppy Grower dies – they get this info by dint of _being_ a Minion, not through their Minion ability. 
- [[Professor]]/[[Shabaloth]]: If a Poppy Grower is resurrected and then dies again, the Minions/Demon are again told who each other are. 
- [[Pukka]]: If a [[Pukka]] kills a Poppy Grower they would never learn their Minions or vice versa because the Poppy Grower would be poisoned when they died to [[Pukka]]. 
- [[Recluse]]: Technically you can wake the [[Recluse]] along with the Minions/Demon when you give them their info… Please don’t. 
- [[Snitch]]: Minions are woken individually and shown three not-in-play characters even if the Poppy Grower is in play. 
- [[Spy]]: Currently jinxed: "If the Poppy Grower is in play, the Spy does not see the Grimoire until the Poppy Grower dies." 
- [[Vortox]]: If a [[Vortox]] is in play when the Poppy Grower dies, the Demon and Minions must be told incorrect players for their respective Minions and Demons as the information is coming from the Poppy Grower – a Townsfolk ability.
- [[Widow]]: Currently jinxed: "If the Poppy Grower is in play, the Widow does not see the Grimoire until the Poppy Grower dies." I believe that a good player would still get the Widow ping at the start of the game, otherwise it confirms to the good team who the Poppy Grower was (or within a couple of options) when the PG dies.

## Tips and Tricks
- Keep it secret keep it safe. The Poppy Grower's biggest strength is the paranoia they create by denying the evil team their greatest strength.

- Come out ridiculously loudly, because someone boldly claiming to be a Poppy Grower so fiercely is just weird, that it is going to make the evil team second guess who you are. They might leave you alive because it seems like you're a character trying to get killed like the [[Farmer]]. Additionally, the Demon may not wish to ‘confirm’ that you’re the Poppy Grower by killing you.

- As the Poppy Grower, you are essentially single-handedly responsible for the evil team's lack of ability to coordinate. Take special notice of any two players who are claiming to be the same character. One of them is possibly a Minion, because they haven’t obtained their bluffs from the Demon.

- On the first day, pay attention to who mingles and who keeps quietly to themselves. Minions, being cut off from the rest of their team, will be extra cautious because they will have no information to start with. Specifically, watch for players' body language as they're likely to unconsciously communicate their anxiety and isolation. Be suspicious of those players who are last to reveal their character, as they might be Minions.

- You are likely to be seen by the evil team as an important target for death in the night. Be very careful about who you share your role with.

- Each day, share your role with one new player. If you die at night early in the game, it's a good chance that one of the people you confided with is actually the Demon specifically, and not a Minion, because a Minion would have no easy way of communicating who you are to the Demon. Of course, nothing stops the Minion from revealing you publicly, but at least you're taking a definite Minion down with you.

- As Poppy Grower, you can pretend to be an evil player to deceive evil players into thinking you are too. Go around secretly to various players and let them know you know a Poppy Grower is in play as code that you're an "evil player". They might bite and confide in you.

- If you die, watch for sudden changes of behaviour. The evil team has suddenly gained a lot of information and can coordinate better. This can include:
    - Players who previously weren't voting, start voting
    - Players who were voting strongly for one player suddenly change their target
    - Players who come out shortly after you die (who have likely just received a bluff from the Demon).

- If you don't come out after you die, the evil team knows exactly who you are but the good team does not. This means that the players who are paying you a little bit too much attention might actually be the evil team trying to hide their actions from you.

- If you can manage to arrange being drunk or poisoned when you die, the evil team do not learn who each other are. While this can be incredibly tricky to pull off as there are not many good characters that can make you intentionally drunk, it has a massive payoff.

- Come out on the final day, if you’re still alive.

## Bluffing
When bluffing as the Poppy Grower, there are a few things you should keep in mind:

- As an evil player, you will know for certain whether there is a Poppy Grower in the game or not. If you learn who your fellow evil players are, there is no Poppy Grower. So, the Poppy Grower can be a safe bluff not only for a Demon who was not shown the Poppy Grower as "not-in-play, but also for the Minions. The Bluff is so safe, that (similar to bluffing as the [[Atheist]]), you may find that other evil players have also claimed to be the Poppy Grower secretly to others, and you have accidentally ended up with several fake Poppy Growers.

- When nominated, claiming to be the only thing stopping the evil team from being introduced to one another can be quite a compelling argument for being spared. However... you will need to come up with an explanation as to why you lived through the night.

- You can tell one or two people that you’re the Poppy Grower and make the good team erroneously believe that they are winning the game.

- Tell no-one that you are the Poppy Grower, get yourself killed by some means, wait until the end of the day, and then announce that particular people who had private conversations today are likely to be evil, since the evil team just found out who each other were.

- If the Poppy Grower is in play, bluffing as the Poppy Grower anyway is likely to lure them out. The real Poppy Grower will know you are lying, but at least the Demon knows which player is the Poppy Grower now. The good team may even be hesitant to execute either of you, for fear that the evil team will learn who each other are once the real Poppy Grower dies.

- Poppy Grower is a great bluff to make after you die. It subtly projects a message that the evil team are about to become much more coordinated than before, and if you’ve already been operating together pretty well, it will make you seem that much more imposing. The good team losing faith in their victory may be the boost you need.

- Poppy Grower games often have a strange vibe to them. Similar to a [[Legion]] game, the good team can feel that something is subtly wrong. It's hard topin down but this is mostly due to the evil team struggling to figure out what their plan is a team. Nevertheless, some games just have a weird feeling to them, as if everyone is being too quiet, or nothing really seems to add up. If your game has this feeling, consider switching from your initial bluff to a Poppy Grower bluff, as a way to explain the feeling to the good team. Coming out as the Poppy Grower after a few days of the good team saying "what is going on? This feels different." may elicit feelings of clarity, and relief. Normally, it is wise to choose a character to bluff as and have that bluff influence the game. Sometimes, it can be wise to let the game dictate which bluff is the most appropriate.
