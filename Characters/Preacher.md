# "Each night, choose a player: a Minion, if chosen, learns this. All chosen Minions have no ability."

## Summary
The Preacher removes the Minion abilities of selected players.
## How to Run
Each night, wake the Preacher and have them choose a player. If they choose a Minion, put a “No Ability” reminder token next to that Minion. Put the Preacher to sleep. If applicable, wake the Minion the Preacher chose tonight, show them the “this character selected you” card and the Preacher token. Put the Minion back to sleep.

From now on, that Minion has no ability. If they would normally wake at night to make a choice, take an action or learn information due to their ability, they no longer do so. If their ability would otherwise have an effect on the game while they are marked by the "No Ability" token, it does not.

If the Preacher dies, remove all “No Ability” tokens from affected Minions. The Minions regain their abilities. Minions with expended once-per-game abilities do not gain another use of that ability. Affected Minions are not told that the Preacher is dead, but may be able to figure it out when they start waking up again etc.

If a Preacher is made drunk or poisoned, Minions who have lost their abilities to the Preacher regain them, but lose them again when the Preacher becomes healthy and sober.

If a Minion who has been chosen by the Preacher later becomes a different type of character (ie not a Minion), they are no longer affected by the Preacher’s ability. Remove the relevant “No Ability” reminder token. Also, evil players are not affected by the Preacher ability just because they’re evil, they need to be explicitly a Minion character in order to be affected.

In a similar vein, a non-Minion who later becomes a Minion is not affected by having been chosen by the Preacher before they became a Minion. If the Preacher chooses them after they become a Minion, the Preacher ability works as normal.

If a preached Minion dies and is resurrected they do not regain their ability, they are still preached provided the Preacher is still alive.
### Examples
>Alex is the Preacher. On the first night, the Preacher chooses the [[Fearmonger]]. The [[Fearmonger]] loses their ability and learns that they have been chosen by the Preacher. On the second night, the Preacher chooses the [[Slayer]]. Nothing happens because the [[Slayer]] is not a Minion. On the third night, the Preacher chooses the [[Po]]. Nothing happens because the [[Po]] is not a Minion. On the fourth night, the Preacher chooses the [[Poisoner]]. The [[Poisoner]] loses their ability and learns that they have been chosen by the Preacher.

>The Preacher has previously chosen the [[Spy]], the [[Saint]], the [[Drunk]], and the [[Goblin]]. The [[Spy]] and the [[Goblin]] have no ability, so the [[Spy]] doesn't see the Grimoire each night, and the [[Goblin]] cannot win by being executed. The Preacher becomes drunk. The [[Spy]] and the [[Goblin]] regain their abilities. The [[Spy]] sees the Grimoire that night, and the [[Goblin]] will win if executed. The Preacher becomes sober, so once again the [[Spy]] and [[Goblin]] have no abilities. The [[Spy]] dies. The Preacher dies. The [[Goblin]] gets their ability back, but the [[Spy]] does not, because the [[Spy]] is dead.

## Discord How to Run


## Interesting Interactions
- [[Alchemist]]/[[Apprentice]]: An [[Alchemist]] or [[Apprentice]] with a Minion ability who is chosen by a Preacher is unaffected, as the Preacher only affects Minions. 
- [[Barista]]: A preached Minion cannot regain their ability by being targeted by a [[Barista]] sober/healthy/true. 
- [[Damsel]]/[[Town Crier]]/[[Balloonist]]/[[Investigator]]: A Minion with no ability due to the Preacher is still a Minion and can guess the [[Damsel]] to trigger the [[Damsel]] ability and register to the [[Town Crier]]/[[Balloonist]]/[[Investigator]] abilities. 
- [[Engineer]]: A preached Minion would be told that they have changed Minion character if the [[Engineer]] acted, but would continue to be affected by the Preacher, and would not regain their ability. 
- [[Legion]]: jinx - Only 1 jinxed character can be in play. 
- [[Lil’ Monsta]]: A Minion who is selected by the Preacher while holding the [[Lil’ Monsta]] token loses their Minion ability, but retains their [[Lil’ Monsta]] Demon ability. 
- [[Magician]]: A [[Magician]] who is selected by the Preacher is not affected. This is because their ability does not make them register as a Minion, it just makes the Demon think they are a Minion. 
- [[Mathematician]]: Minions who would normally wake or use abilities, but who do not do so as a result of being preached, register as having their abilities working abnormally to the [[Mathematician]]. 
- [[Marionette]]: A [[Marionette]] who is selected by the Preacher will wake and learn that this has happened. They no longer have anything that makes them “think they are a good character”, and will no longer be woken at night to use an ability. They will not explicitly be told they are evil or the [[Marionette]], but will probably be able to figure it out. 
- [[Mezepheles]]: If preached on the first night, they do not learn their word. However, if the Preacher ever dies or gets droisoned, the [[Mezepheles]] would learn their word at that point. If the [[Mezepheles]] was preached on a later night, players who say the word after that point do not turn evil but still use up the [[Mezepheles]] ability, ditto if a player said the word in the day preceding the night during which the [[Mezepheles]] was preached. Players cannot say “the word” before the [[Mezepheles]] themselves has learnt it, it functionally doesn’t exist until the [[Mezepheles]] has been told it, so prior usages of the relevant word don’t count as the one use of the ability for either using it up or turning players evil. 
- [[Pit-Hag]]/[[Barber]]/[[Engineer]]: Good Minions are affected the same as evil ones if selected by the Preacher – alignment is not relevant. If a preached Minion becomes not a Minion, they are no longer affected, even if they later become a Minion again. If a preached Minion is changed to a different Minion, however, they are still preached. Changed Minions still learn about their character change per standard game rules. 
- [[Professor]]/[[Al-Hadikhia]]/[[Shabaloth]]: If a Preacher is killed and resurrected, their preaching is reset, Minions they selected before death would have regained their abilities and would keep them even after the Preacher is resurrected unless picked again. 
- [[Recluse]]: The [[Recluse]] can register as a Minion to the Preacher and learn that the Preacher selected them. You probably shouldn’t usually do this - note that if you do, the [[Recluse]] still keeps their ability - if the [[Recluse]] loses their ability they cease to register as a Minion, which means the reminder token should be removed and therefore they are no longer preached so their ability is returned. 
- [[Riot]]: jinx - “[[Riot]] registers as a Minion to the Preacher”. If all living [[Riot]] are selected by the Preacher, the Riot ability is no longer active, and nominations & voting will go back to working as they normally would. While even 1 living [[Riot]] remains unpreached, the [[Riot]] ability will remain in-play. 
- [[Spy]]: The [[Spy]] can register as a non-Minion when selected by the Preacher and avoid being affected by the ability. 
- [[Vigormortis]]: The Preacher may select dead Minions who are under the ability-retaining effects of the [[Vigormortis]]. In this situation, the Preacher ability wins out, and the Minions lose their abilities as normal. If the Preacher then dies, Minions who were affected will then regain their abilities. 
- [[Widow]]: If picked by the Preacher on night 1, they do not get to look in the grimoire. As the [[Widow]] specifically only gets to look in the grimoire on their first night, being preached on night 1 prevents them from ever looking in the grimoire or poisoning a player, even if the Preacher dies or is made drunk/poisoned later in the game. In addition, if a [[Widow]] is preached Night 1, a good player will not learn that a [[Widow]] is in-play - the same as if the [[Widow]] chose to poison themselves. If the Preacher dies, if the [[Widow]] is still alive at that point, a good player would learn a [[Widow]] is in play, but the [[Widow]] would not see the grimoire or poison anyone.

## Tips and Tricks
- The Preacher’s ability can turn Minion abilities off. They learn this but will get it back as soon as you’re dead. While you don’t know whether you’ve successfully hit a Minion or not, watch your targets carefully the next day and see if their behaviour changes. If they do, and they suddenly seem more enthusiastic for executions, then you’ve probably got a Minion.

- Be careful about revealing that you are the Preacher! Your ability is a thorn in the side of the evil team, defusing their [[Boomdandy]] or outsmarting their [[Mezepheles]]. Even just the threat of taking a minion's ability away could unravel the evil team's elaborate plan, and thus make you a priority for death. Try to bluff as a more innocuous Townsfolk, or even an Outsider like the [[Butler]] or the [[Barber]]!

- If a player is acting suspicious and they’re keeping to themselves, that’s a good target for you. While both good and evil players have reasons for trying not to be noticed, you have no effect on good players who aren’t actually Minions just trying to keep out of sight. You have nothing to lose for taking the shot in the dark!

- On the first day, listen carefully for people who are making public claims. Remember that Minions do not get bluffs and tend to be the last to come out publicly. The players who get embroiled in double claims or only come out later into the game are very good targets for your ability.

- If you have to pick between two potential Minions, pick the one doing the most ongoing damage. Hitting an [[Assassin]] after they've already killed doesn't really achieve too much for your team, but a [[Widow]] losing their ability has still seen the Grimoire, but will lose their ability to poison. A [[Pit-Hag]] would be a even more urgent priority again!

- Once you're dead, coming out is important if you suspect you've disabled some minions - now that you're dead, those abilities are back online now and a threat to your town!

- The Preacher can target dead players! While this may not be helpful most of the time, this does make you a surprise counter to the [[Vigormortis]] and an evil aligned [[Bone Collector]]. Some future Minions may even keep their abilities while dead - not that this keeps them safe from you!

## Bluffing
When bluffing as the Preacher, there are a few things you should keep in mind:

- Bluffing as the Preacher can be a little tricky, because even a real Preacher doesn’t have much feedback in the game to back up their claims. However, you can use your pretend ability to throw a little bit of shade on other players or build trust.

- To lend credibility to your bluff, you can coordinate with the evil team to make a minion ability disappear! Just use a minion ability that has a public tell (like the [[Witch]] or [[Cerenovus]]), and then mask that ability by picking evil players for a time instead. You can then lay the blame for the lack of [[Witch]] deaths or madness at the feed of whatever poor innocent good player you please, claiming that since you "preached" them, that ability has vanished!

- Be cautious of who you accuse to be a minion! If the town believes you, they won't consider that person a demon target, and since you have neutralised them, they might prefer to go around executing unknowns as opposed to the good players you're tarring with your accusations! (Of course, if you suspect they're going to do this, you can always deliberately throw shade on your Demon - the town will dismiss them as an insignificant Minion and leave them alone for another day!)

- If someone’s behaviour dramatically changes from one night to the next, you can suggest that the change in their behaviour is because you’re the Preacher and you chose them last night. This implies that they’re suddenly acting differently because they’re just learned they have no ability.

- You can try to use your ability to build trust. You can go secretly up to a good player and confide to them that you used your Preacher ability on them last night. You can go on to suggest that because they don’t seem to be acting very differently, you trust them more because they’re probably not a Minion (obviously you know they aren’t, but they don’t know that). This has a similar impact to a [[Butler]] bluff - alone a Preacher doesn't have any way of confirming the people they choose, but just the act of being chosen and "cleared" can inspire trust in the other player.

- If your bluff is falling apart, you can claim to have been the Preacher all along as a fallback. The Preacher is a prime target for the evil team if they come out, so it will make sense that you lied. This can serve as a last-ditch effort to survive execution as well, since you can warn that minions will regain their powers without you!

- Deliberately die at night and come out as a Preacher to throw shade on some good players! You can have the demon kill you, or you can star-pass yourself if you're a demon like the [[Fang Gu]] for example. A Preacher dying at night has a lot more credibility than one who is executed.

- Once you are dead, you can really sell that you're the real, bonafide Preacher if you have a minion accomplice still alive. Simply have them mask their ability's existence until you're dead, and then go to town causing trouble in a public way (e.g. An [[Assassin]] kill or a [[Devil's Advocate]] execution block). Point out that you died just after you picked a certain player, and now the minions are running rampant! It's tricky, but pull it off and the town will not only be sad you died, but furious with the patsy you have named the minion!
