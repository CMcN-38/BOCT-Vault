# "Each night, if the dead outnumber the living, you learn 1 alive character. The Demon knows who you are."

## Summary
The King learns which characters are still alive.

- The King only gains this ability after a few nights have passed—once the dead players outnumber the living.
- At the start of the game, the Demon learns who the King is. If a King is created mid-game, the Demon learns who the King is that night.
- The King may not survive long enough to use their ability. Once the number of dead players is greater than the number of alive players, the King learns one alive character each night.
- The King may learn good or evil characters, and may even learn the same character more than once.
- There may not be a Choirboy in play. But if there is, and they are still alive when the Demon kills the King, the Choirboy learns who the Demon is.
## How to Run
During the first night, wake the Demon. Show them the **THIS PLAYER IS** info token, then the King token, then point at the King player. Put the Demon to sleep.

When the number of dead players exceeds the number of alive players, add a night token to the King’s entry on the night sheet. Each night, if the King has a night token on the night sheet, wake the King. Show one alive character token. Put the King to sleep.

>Think carefully about what character tokens to show the King. Don’t be afraid to give great information. Most Kings will die before the final day. A King that lives to the final day will usually win, and that’s ok.

>Optional rule: the King learns an alive character once the dead **equal or outnumber** the living. (This makes the King more fun to play in games with an even number of players.)
### Examples
>Amy is the King. There are 12 players alive, and one dead player. On the second night, she learns nothing. On the third night, she learns nothing. On the fourth day, there are 7 dead players and 6 alive players. On the fourth night, Amy learns that the [[Snitch]] is alive. On the fifth night, she learns that the [[Witch]] is alive.

>The Demon knows that Julian is the King. Evin is claiming to be the [[Choirboy]], but is the [[Butler]]. The Demon takes a risk and kills Julian. If Evin was actually the [[Choirboy]], he would have learnt which player was the Demon.


## Discord How to Run
On the first night, wake the Demon and show the King token, then point to the King player. As the game progresses, as each night gets to the King point in the night order, count the dead players (remember to include anyone that’s died before the King’s turn) and if there are more dead than alive, wake the King and show 1 alive in play character token. 

The King can learn good or evil characters and may learn the same character more than once if applicable. The King can only be made drunk/poisoned before the Demon is informed of them on night 1 by the [[No Dashii,]] all other drunk/poison happens after the King's identity is known to the Demon (except if the [[Philosopher]] chooses King, in which case the Demon would be learning that the [[Philosopher]] player is the King, not the actual King). 

If the King is actually the Drunk the Demon is not told who they are. If the King is drunk/poisoned when they would wake, they can be shown character tokens that are not in play or in play but dead. If they are drunk/poisoned when they would not yet wake, in theory you could wake them and give them arbitrary info, but it’d be pretty clear when the morning came that the criteria for them waking was not met and therefore they would know they were drunk/poisoned, so you shouldn’t do this unless there’s an in-script reason that the death count would fluctuate sufficiently for it to seem reasonable

## Interesting Interactions
- [[Cannibal]]: If the King is executed with a [[Cannibal]] in play, the Demon would be woken that night to learn who the Kingibal is. 
- Chambermaid: The King does not wake until the point the dead outnumber the living, so would not register to Chambermaid before that, then start registering after that point. 
- [[Philosopher]]/[[Pixie]]: Same as the [[Cannibal]], gaining the King ability would notify the Demon of the PhiloRuler/Kingxie. The Demon should just be shown that the relevant player is the King, not the Philo/[[Pixie]]. 
- [[Poppy Grower]]: Does not affect the Demon learning who the King is. 
- Professor/Shabaloth/Bone Collector: Resurrecting the King would result in the Demon being told again who the King is. 
- [[Snake Charmer/]][[Barber]]/[[Pit-Hag]]/[[Scarlet Woman]]/[[Fang Gu]]/[[Imp]]/[[Lil’ Monsta]]: if the Demon changes player, the new Demon player would be told who the King is, if the King is alive. 
- [[Barber]]/[[Pit-Hag]]: If the King is swapped to another player or created anew, the Demon is told the identity of the new King player. 
- [[Drunk]]/[[Marionette]]: If the King is chosen to be the [[Drunk]]/[[Marionette]], the Demon is not notified of which player it is. 
- [[Goon]]: The King does not actively target the [[Goon]] with their ability, so can be shown the [[Goon]] token without being made drunk. 
- [[Lunatic]]: The [[Lunatic]] can be told that a King is in play, either correctly or incorrectly. 
- [[Recluse]]: Technically you can show the [[Recluse]] who the King is by registering them as the Demon, but this will rarely be fun. 
- [[Legion]]: You can show as many or as few of the [[Legion]] as you like that the King is in play. I would always show at least one, however. 
- [[Vortox]]: Is told the incorrect player is the King. King learns false info – i.e. characters that are either not in play or already dead. 
- [[Zombuul]]: Counts as dead for the King’s “dead outnumber the living” requirement. 
- [[Apprentice]]: If gaining the King ability, the Demon is told. 
- [[Barista]]: Only has an effect on the King once the dead outnumber the living. Once this is the case, 1) gives the King true info, 2) gives the King two character tokens to see.

## Tips and Tricks
- The King is one of the few characters who can come out early and confidently. The Demon knows who the King is and knows they might be a possible trap if killed too early in the game. Because the Demon can only kill the King if they’re confident the [[Choirboy]] is out of the way, the King is likely to survive to the end game.

- The King can also wait secretly. The King gets a lot of really good information at the end of the game, and while Kings often come out, staying silent might be a good way to throw the Demon off. You can quietly watch for players who seem to be paying you too much attention as this might be the Demon.

- The King’s protection from the Demon lasts as long as the [[Choirboy]] is alive. Find another good player and secretly let others know that they are the [[Choirboy]]. If there is no [[Choirboy]] in play, this might help drive the Demon mad as they desperately hunt for the [[Choirboy]]. If there is one in play, it provides a false target for the Demon, helping the [[Choirboy]] (and therefore you) to stay alive.

- Coming out straight away as the King creates a fun gambit. Because the only other characters who are certain whether the King is in play or not are the [[Choirboy]] and the Demon. By coming out straight away, you’re throwing down a challenge that suggests you’re either the King or the Demon. In this way, you can ask people for their characters with the promise that you will consent to be executed before the final night to lessen suspicion that you’re the Demon.

- Because the King’s information at the end of the game can be very powerful and because Kings are prime suspects of being the Demon, the chance that a public King survives to the end game is quite low. If you go public, focus on using your position to form a trusted court around you rather than surviving.

- There is a lot of fun in being the King and holding court. Make other players come to you and tell you their secrets, rather than wandering around the court like a peasant.

## Bluffing
When bluffing as the King, there are a few things you should keep in mind:

- The King can be a really fun character to bluff as. Players are likely to be more accepting of Kings as being loud and directing the flow of the game. Being the King gives you a great excuse to try and steer the narrative of the game, because you should have a lot of character information at your fingertips.

- It can be really helpful to build a circle of trust with a bunch of players, because if you survive until the late game, you can help verify or deny the character claims other players are making. You can support the bluff another evil player is maKing by announcing it is in play, or you can throw shade on a player by suggesting their character was never revealed to you.

- If you’re a Minion, come out publicly as the King straight away, since most players will believe you are either the King or the Demon at that point. If there is a King in play, it will make them more distrusted, undermining any information they get - even if it throws you under the bus at the same time. It’s a great way to get yourself and the real King executed, thus eliminating the problem they pose for the Demon.

- If you survive to the end game, use the fake information you have to make powerful revelations. Confirm the bluff of a fellow evil player. Suggest that a particular Minion or a particular Demon is in play when they are not. Just be careful to make sure your information is consistent with the game so far.

- Since the [[Choirboy]] can only be in play if the King is in play, if the Demon learns there is no King in play they also know the [[Choirboy]] is not. This could potentially be twoextra bluffs (which you can give your Minions) on top of those you learn at the start of the game.
