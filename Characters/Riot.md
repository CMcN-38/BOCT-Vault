# "Nominees die, but may nominate again immediately (on day 3, they must). After day 3, evil wins. [All Minions are Riot]"

## Summary
Riot kills everybody in a panic.

- Each player that is nominated dies immediately. Even though they are dead, they may nominate again today. This may happen multiple times per day.
- The player that was nominated must nominate again immediately or lose their chance to do so. The Storyteller counts down “3... 2... 1...” to let the player know how long they have to nominate, should they wish to. If they don’t, no more nominations are allowed today.
- The good team wins if all Riot players are dead. If the last Riot dies and only two players are alive, they do not nominate, and the good team wins.
- On the third day, each nominated player must nominate again. If they do not, the Storyteller will nominate on their behalf, or declare that that player’s team loses.
- If just three players are alive when the third day nominations begin, the group chooses which player nominates first. If no one nominates, the day ends and evil wins.
## How to Run
While setting up the game, before putting the character tokens in the bag, replace all Minion tokens with Riot tokens. During the first night, skip the Minion Info step. During the Demon Info step, wake all Riot players and allow them to make eye contact. Show each Riot player three character bluffs, then put them to sleep.

Each time a player is nominated, they **die**. Declare that they are dead, and add a shroud immediately. Tell them that they may nominate again. Publicly count down “3... 2... 1...” and if they nominate before their time runs out, repeat this process for the new nominee (_they **die**, may nominate etc._) If they do not nominate before their time runs out, the day ends.

On the third day, nominated players **die** and must nominate again. If the day ends with more than two players alive, evil wins.

>Optional Rule: When Riot is in play, the dead may not be nominated. (This is more fun, and is the original intent of Riot.)
### Examples
>Alex nominates Lewis. Lewis dies and nominates Ben. Ben dies and nominates Marianna. Marianna dies and nominates Lachlan. Lachlan dies but does not nominate. Four players died today.

>On the third day, a Riot player is nominated. They die and nominate the Amnesiac, who dies and nominates the Empath, who dies and nominates a Riot player. The game ends immediately, as all Riot players are dead.

## Discord How to Run
When setting up the game, put no Minion tokens into the bag. Instead, replace the relevant number of Minion tokens with Riot tokens. On the first night, there are no Minions, so skip Minion info. Instead, wake all Riot during the Demon info step and allow them to make eye contact, then show all of them three bluffs. 

From now on, any time a player is nominated, they die immediately. Declare they are dead and mark them accordingly (after the first Riot nomination, a dead player should try to keep the town square up to date as nominations go around to make it easier to tell who is dead for players nominating). That player may nominate immediately, but you should count down on your fingers “3…2…1…”. If they do not nominate in time, nominations are over for today, put everyone to sleep. If they do nominate, repeat the process for each new nominee until either the game is over or someone declines to nominate and you go to night. 

On the third day, if a player declines to nominate, the Storyteller either nominates on their behalf or declares that player’s team loses. Note that the point of this clause is not to allow players to game the system and force the ST to nominate on their behalf to get information, it’s to obligate players to nominate, so please don’t try to take advantage of this. If, as a Storyteller, you think one team/player is trying to manipulate this situation, end the game in the other team’s favour instead and I would recommend having a conversation with your players about playing in the spirit of the game rather than trying to game the system. 

If there are just three players alive when the third day nominations begin, the group chooses which player nominates first. In person, allow some discussion as you normally would before nominations, then run a Boomdandy style “on the count of three, everyone point at the person you want to nominate first” vote, then the person with the most pointing at them gets to nominate. Online, you can run 3 quick votes, one on each person, with the one getting the most votes nominating. 

Dead players may not be nominated at any point in a Riot game. 

If a player who has already nominated is nominated, the Riot ability supercedes the standard game rule that they may not nominate twice, so they may nominate again. However, the game rule that a player may only be nominated once each day still applies. 

Calling for the exile of a Traveller does not kill them immediately. Riot only affects nominations, so a Traveller exile vote should be run as normal. There should be no interruptions once a Riot nomination train is rolling, so all calls for Traveller exiles should occur before nominations open. 

If a single Riot player is drunk/poisoned with other living Riot, this has no effect, the other Riot abilities in play still enforce Riot nomination rules. However, if every single living Riot player is drunk/poisoned, there is no Riot ability in play causing Riot nomination deaths to happen, so nominations and voting occur as usual. If it is past day 3 and any single Riot sobers up, evil wins immediately.

## Interesting Interactions
- [[Balloonist]]: Can only ever get a maximum of three nights of info, which is fortunate, given that there should never be Minions in a Riot game, so they should get one Town, one Outsider and one Riot if they survive long enough! 
- [[Barber]]: Like any Demon that has multiple players, the ST picks a living Demon to make the [[Barber]] swap. 
- [[Barista]]: No effect on Riot from [[Barista]] 1, [[Barista]] 2 means nominees die twice if possible, so one nomination could kill a [[Fool]]. Note this does not have to be the [[Barista]]-doubled Riot that nominates the [[Fool]], any player nominating a [[Fool]] with a [[Barista]]-doubled Riot in play would kill them twice. 
- [[Beggar]]/[[Bishop]]/[[Bureaucrat]]/[[Butcher]]/[[Gunslinger]]/[[Judge]]/[[Scapegoat]]/[[Thief]]/[[Voudon]]: Largely pointless in a Riot game, I’d avoid using them. They’re not specifically jinxed and for some of them you could absolutely come up with ways to make them work with a house rule, but I’d generally avoid them. Not least because Riot games are _quick_ so there’s generally not any need for players to travel in or away. 
- [[Butler]]: jinx - "The [[Butler]] can not nominate their master." 
- [[Cannibal]]: jinx – "Players that die by nomination register as being executed to the [[Cannibal]].” Therefore the [[Cannibal]]’s “most recently executee” becomes the last player to die to nomination that day. 
- [[Clockmaker]]: jinx – “Riot registers as a Minion to the [[Clockmaker]].” Steven has confirmed that, contrary to our prior understanding, for LM/[[Legion]]/Riot these would all entail showing the [[Clockmaker]] the _smallest gap_ 
- [[Courtier]]: If the [[Courtier]] picks Riot, precisely one Riot player is made drunk, which Riot player is chosen by the Storyteller. 
- [[Damsel]]: jinx – “Riot registers as a Minion to the [[Damsel]].” i.e. Riot are all told about the [[Damsel]] being in play and any Riot may claim to be a Minion and guess who the [[Damsel]] is. 
- [[Devil’s Advocate]]: jinx - "Players that die by nomination register as being executed to the [[Devil's Advocate]]." 
- [[Engineer]]: jinx - "Riot and the [[Engineer]] can not both be in play at the start of the game. If the [[Engineer]] creates Riot, the evil players become Riot." 
- [[Exorcist]]: jinx - "Only 1 jinxed character can be in play.” 
- [[Farmer]]: jinx - "If a Riot player nominates and kills a [[Farmer]], the [[Farmer]] uses their ability tonight." 
- [[Flowergirl]]: jinx - "Only 1 jinxed character can be in play.” 
- [[Fool]]: If nominated in a Riot game, uses their first death, but must still nominate again. (i.e. “I nominate [[Fool]] player”, “player does not die, who do you nominate? 3…2…1…” etc) 
- [[Golem]]: jinx - "If the [[Golem]] nominates Riot, the Riot player does not die." This is because if the [[Golem]] is nominated in the middle of a chain, they die immediately, i.e. before their nomination, so their ability would not be in effect when they nominate and therefore the [[Golem]] has no ability in a Riot game – hence the jinx. If the [[Golem]] is the first nominator of the day (using up their once per game nomination) and then is later nominated, they can nominate a second time to carry on the chain, because they are dead immediately on being nominated, so the [[Golem]] nomination restriction ability is no longer in effect. 
- [[Goon]]: Cannot generally be turned evil in a Riot game as they are only turned by night choices, so they are entirely on the good team in the absence of something else turning evil, but can still make other good players drunk. 
- [[Grandmother]]: “If a Riot player nominates and kills the grandchild, the [[Grandmother]] dies too.” 
- [[Innkeeper]]: jinx - "If a Riot player nominates an [[Innkeeper]]-protected-player, the [[Innkeeper]]-protected-player does not die." 
- [[Investigator]]: jinx – “Riot registers as a Minion to the [[Investigator]].” So an [[Investigator]] would be woken and shown two players, one of which is Riot, and any Minion token. 
- [[King]]: All Riot learn who the [[King]] is as they all register as Demons. Jinx – “If a Riot player nominates and kills the [[King]] and the [[Choirboy]] is alive, the [[Choirboy]] uses their ability tonight.” This applies even if the [[Choirboy]] dies later the same day before learning their information. This jinx is on the [[King]] rather than the [[Choirboy]] to draw Riot’s attention to the fact that it's nominating the [[King]] that will trigger the jinx, not nominating the [[Choirboy]]. 
- [[Klutz]]: Riot is all about high-pressure quick choices, so you should let your players know they will need to make those same quick choices if they die as the [[Klutz]] (foregoing the usual period for town to discuss who they should pick). I would announce they’ve died, then start the usual 3 second count for a Riot nomination, during which they should claim [[Klutz]] and pick a player, you as Storyteller can then confirm that the game continues or doesn’t as applicable, then restart the 3 second Riot nomination countdown. 
- [[Lunatic]]: All Riot learn who the [[Lunatic]] is and who they pick. On a Riot + [[Lunatic]] script, you should wake each Riot player individually to give them their bluffs, the [[Lunatic]]'s identity if applicable and their other demon players. Otherwise the [[Lunatic]] knows if they're the [[Lunatic]] or not immediately.
- [[Lycanthrope]]: Doesn’t prevent deaths during the day, only during the night. 
- [[Magician]]: If the [[Magician]] is in play, Riot don't wake together. They are woken one by one and shown who their fellow Riot are, including the [[Magician]]. 
- [[Mayor]]: jinx – “If the 3rd day begins with just three players alive, the players may choose (as a group) not to nominate at all. If so (and a [[Mayor]] is alive) then the [[Mayor]]'s team wins.” 
- [[Minstrel]]: jinx - "Only 1 jinxed character can be in play.” 
- [[Monk]]: jinx – "If a Riot player nominates the [[Monk]]-protected-player, the [[Monk]]-protected-player does not die." 
- [[Moonchild]]: See [[Klutz]] Pacifist: jinx - "Players that die by nomination register as being executed to the Pacifist." 
- [[Philosopher]]: First up, probably don’t put a [[Philosopher]] in a Riot script unless you’re prepared for jinxes to happen. Secondly, think carefully about other characters you put on the script if Riot and [[Philosopher]] are both on there. If you insist on doing it anyway, I have ruled (and Steven has confirmed he’s happy with this ruling) that if the [[Philosopher]] picks a character that is not-both-in-play jinxed ("Only 1 jinxed character can be in play.”) with something else that is already in play, you should make that the one use of the [[Philosopher]]’s ability, then tell the [[Philosopher]] the opposing jinxed character is in play. I.e. If, with Riot in play, the [[Philosopher]] chose the [[Exorcist]], I would show the [[Philosopher]] the Riot token, put them back to sleep and not wake them up again. (This will likely involve telling your players this is how this interaction will work before the game begins, as it’s out of the ordinary.) This is because they cannot gain the opposing ability without the game being broken in some way, but being able to hard-confirm that Riot (or [[Legion]], or whatever else is not-both-in-play jinxed) is or isn’t in play is super powerful and probably worth the use of the once per game ability. 
- [[Pit-Hag]]: jinx – "If the [[Pit-Hag]] creates Riot, all evil players become Riot. If the [[Pit-Hag]] creates Riot after day 3, the game continues for one more day." 
- [[Pixie]]: Could gain their new ability during the day and have it take effect before they were even aware they had it. E.g. [[Pixie]] [[Tea Lady]] that immediately starts protecting their neighbours when the original [[Tea Lady]] is nominated. If the [[Pixie]] gains a “start knowing” ability due to a Riot death during the day, but dies during the same day, they would not be woken up to gain it that night. 
- [[Poppy Grower]]: Each Riot wakes up individually and is shown their bluffs but not their fellow Riot players. 
- [[Preacher]]: jinx - "Riot registers as a Minion to the [[Preacher]]." 
- [[Puzzlemaster]]: If the [[Puzzlemaster]] successfully guesses their drunk player, they learn any living Riot player. 
- [[Ravenkeeper]]: jinx - "If a Riot player nominates and kills the [[Ravenkeeper]], the [[Ravenkeeper]] uses their ability tonight." 
- [[Sage]]: jinx - "If a Riot player nominates and kills a [[Sage]], the [[Sage]] uses their ability tonight." 
- [[Saint]]: jinx - "If a good player nominates and kills the [[Saint]], the [[Saint]]'s team loses." 
- [[Snitch]]: jinx - "If the [[Snitch]] is in play, each Riot player gets an extra 3 bluffs. " 
- [[Soldier]]: jinx - "If a Riot player nominates the [[Soldier]], the [[Soldier]] does not die." The [[Soldier]] is also not forced to nominate, though it is usually in their interests to do so. Nonetheless, it is part of the Demon ability, which the Soldier is safe from, so even on the 3rd day they are not obligated to nominate. Having said that, a Storyteller on days 1 and 2 would still do the three-second countdown and then end the day if the [[Soldier]] did not nominate. On day 3, I would do the countdown anyway, the [[Soldier]] is technically not forced to nominate, but if they don't nominate in time, I would end the day and therefore end the game with a Riot win. 
- [[Tea Lady]]: If both living neighbours are good, they cannot die due to Riot on nomination, but they are still able to (forced to on day 3) nominate again. 
- [[Town Crier]]: jinx - "Riot registers as a Minion to the [[Town Crier]]."
- [[Undertaker]]: jinx - "Players that die by nomination register as being executed to the [[Undertaker]]."
- [[Virgin]]: If the [[Virgin]] is nominated by a Townsfolk in a Riot game, the [[Virgin]] dies and the Townsfolk is immediately executed, ending the day.
## Tips and Tricks
- Since all evil players are the Demon, all evil players get 3 bluffs at the start of the game. Communicate early on so that you don't accidentally choose the same bluffs, as the good team is likely to nominate and kill any suspicious players as early as possible.

- Pay attention to the jinxes, and ask the Storyteller for clarification on any jinxed character that you intend to bluff as. Riot is a very unusual Demon and breaks the game's core rules in a number of ways, so has some unusual character interactions with Townsfolk that gain information or have mechanics based around nominations, executions, and voting. Make sure you know how your jinxed character operates so that you can bluff effectively.

- Before nominations begin, think about one or two players that you would like to nominate. Once nominations begin, things get a little bit hectic, and if you are nominated you will only have a single chance to kill a player for the entire game, so make it count. If your number one player is dead when it becomes your turn to nominate, nominate your number two player instead.

- Don't be afraid to nominate good players that are trusted, powerful, or both. Since there will be no deaths at night, killing trusted good players early in the game avoids the very real possibility that you will need to face them when only 3 or 4 players are left alive. Even if nominating a trusted good player makes you look evil, it is often best to get them out of the way early on. If you are nominated and die as a result, then other Riot players may keep the game going.

- If you are nominated on day one or two, nominate another player. This is your only chance to kill a player, and it is best to remove good players that may act tonight, so that the good team has less information on the final day. The best case scenario is that the good player you nominate will nominate another good player, and that player will nominate again. The worst case scenario is that the player that you nominate doesn't nominate again, but that still means one less good player alive. While it is unlikely that you will be able to win the game on day one or two, any attrition that you can cause on these days grants the good team less information to work with.

- On day three, remember that you must nominate if you are nominated. Hesitation may look very suspicious.

- Nominate players that look like they have given little thought to who they will nominate. Or nominate randomly. The more the good players feel rushed and confused, the poorer decisions they will make. Pretending to be flustered, rushed and confused yourself can go a long way into keeping up the pretence that you are a good player. This may not even be pretence.

- Be the first player to nominate each day, if possible. Pay attention to the Storyteller and when it looks like they are going to call for nominations. If you are the first player to nominate, then you kill a player without dying yourself. So, if you are nominated and die, you get to nominate a second player. This is very handy.

- If you want to appear to be a good player, don't nominate on days one or two. The downside is that you don't get to kill a player, but if you are bluffing as a character that is crucial to the decisions that the good team are making, such as the [[Fortune Teller]] or the [[Town Crier]], then appearing to be trustworthy might result in the good team nominating more good players.

- Don't be afraid to die. Normally, the Demon should stay alive at all costs. When you are Riot, dying isn't that much of a downside, as long as other Riot are still alive. Riot is particularly suited to bluffing as characters that have game-altering effects when they die, such as the [[Sage]], [[Klutz]] or [[Ravenkeeper]].

- Unlike other Demons, the evil team wins when there are three players alive and two of them are evil, because whoever is nominated, the remaining two players will contain at least one Demon. If the player count is small, campaigning to be a character that is very important to keep alive can scare the good team into completely avoiding nominating you. You will need to make these arguments before nominations begin each day though, as the nomination phase leaves no time for talk.

## Fighting Riot
- If Riot is on the script, nominate on the first day. Sure, a player will die, but at least you know which Demon you are facing and can avoid a complete panic by finding out on day three.

- Be the first player to nominate. If you are first, you kill a player without dying, and can kill another player if you are nominated later on. This means that you have double the chances of killing a Demon, and may even kill two.

- If you have good reason to believe that Riot is in play, because it is the only Demon on the script or the other Demons don't seem to be active, then consider not nominating at all on days one and two and convincing the group to do the same. The more players that are alive on day three, the more good abilities have had a chance to activate and the more information will be available for all good players to evaluate. Unlike a normal Demon, where executing each day means that you have more chances to execute the Demon, every player has (at least) one chance to kill the Demon, regardless of which day it is. Saving all nominations until day three may be the best option.

- If you are nominated on day one or two, you have a decision to make: do you nominate again, or cease nominations for the day? If you nominate again, you might kill a Demon. If you don't nominate again, you avoid accidentally killing too many players too soon and also signal to the good team that you are indeed good by ending the day without further casualties. Most Riots will nominate again on day one or two, so this is a chance to stand out from the crowd. This is your choice to make.

- Before nominations begin, think about one, two, or three players that you would like to nominate. Once nominations begin, things get a little bit hectic, and if you are nominated you will only have a single chance to kill a player for the entire game, so make it count. If your number one player is dead when it becomes your turn to nominate, nominate your number two player instead.

- On day 3, even a hasty nomination is better than no nomination at all. If you don't nominate, either the game is over or the Storyteller will nominate a player on your behalf, and you can be certain that they will not be helpful to you.

- Make your arguments as to why you should not be nominated before nominations begin each day, as the nomination phase leaves no time for talk.

- Pay attention to which players are nominating trusted players. They are probably evil. Or they may just be good players forced into a too hasty decision.
