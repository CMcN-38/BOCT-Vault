# "You have a not-in-play Minion ability."

## Summary
The Alchemist has a Minion ability.

- The Alchemist’s ability must be that of a not-in-play Minion. It cannot duplicate an in-play Minion’s ability.
- The Alchemist learns which ability this is on the first night.
- They are still a good Townsfolk. They win when good wins, and lose when good loses. They register as good and as the Alchemist.
- The Alchemist does not wake to learn who the other Minions are or who the Demon is, like Minions do.
- If the Alchemist’s Minion ability adds or removes characters during setup, this still occurs during setup.
## How to Run
During the first night, wake the Alchemist. Show the **YOU ARE** info token then the character token of a not-in-play Minion. Put the Alchemist to sleep. Mark the Alchemist with the **IS THE ALCHEMIST** reminder. Swap the Alchemist token with this Minion token. Turn the Minion token upside-down. (_This shows they are still good._)

The Alchemist has this Minion ability. They use it as if they were a Minion, and wake at night when that Minion would normally wake to use their ability.
### Examples
>The Alchemist has the [[Poisoner]]’s ability. Each night, the Alchemist wakes and chooses a player to poison.

>The Alchemist has the [[Scarlet Woman]]’s ability. The [[Imp]] kills themselves at night, and the Alchemist becomes the good [[Imp]].

>The Alchemist has the [[Assassin]]’s ability. The [[Dreamer]] chooses the Alchemist. The [[Dreamer]] learns that they are either the Alchemist or the [[Assassin]].

## Discord How to Run
On their first night, wake the Alchemist, show them the “you are” card and the character token of a not-in-play Minion. Swap the Alchemist token with this Minion token, putting the Minion token upside down to remind you their alignment is the inverse of the token colour (or, on clocktower.online, mark them with a “Good” reminder token). Put the “Is the Alchemist” reminder token next to the Minion token. 

The Alchemist has this Minion ability from now on. They wake as if they were the Minion, make choices as if they were the Minion and affect the game as if they were the Minion. However, they are not a Minion, they are the Alchemist, so alignment, character and character type detectors detect good, Alchemist and Townsfolk respectively and things that affect Minions specifically do not affect the Alchemist. They also do not wake for Minion info because they are not actually a Minion, nor are they shown to the Demon in Demon info. 

Functionally, the Alchemist should be treated as having "the ability of a not-in-play Minion" rather than "a Minion ability that is not in play". Therefore if there is an [[Apprentice]], the Alchemist and the Apprentice can both have the same ability, they are not blocking each other by making a Minion ability be in play. 

Note that the Alchemist has this ability from setup, when you decide what Minion ability they will have, so [square brackets] in an Alchemist ability are in effect, i.e. an Alchemist [[Baron]] or [[Godfather]] will affect the Outsider count etc. 

The Alchemist night order location is going to need to be adjusted on the fly by the ST to match their ability. The night order location they have on N1 is in case they are given the [[Poisoner]] ability and need to be able to poison first. If they gain other Minion abilities, their night order location should be adjusted so that they are identically droisonable as the source Minion whose ability they're gaining.
 
If an Alchemist dies and is resurrected or is swapped, the Minion ability possessed by the new Alchemist may change if there is more than one not-in-play Minion available. If an Alchemist is drunk/poisoned on N1, they can (but don’t have to) be told that they have a different Minion ability to the one they actually have, which may or may not be in play. For as long as they are drunk/poisoned they should be woken as though they have this ability. If they do not start drunk/poisoned but become drunk/poisoned during the game, it’s easiest to just leave them thinking they have the Minion ability they were told, but for it to no longer function. It is, however, legal to tell them they now have a different Minion ability assuming that’s feasible (see [[Pit-Hag]] interaction below). 

In a [[Vortox]] game, the Alchemist would have to learn an in-play Minion ability: learning which Minion is out-of-play is regarded as information and therefore should be falsified. They would, however, be woken to make choices as per the ability they actually have, not the one they were told, so might be able to work this out.

## Interesting Interactions
- [[Apprentice]]: Can gain the Alchemist ability and then gain a Minion ability while good. 
- [[Bounty Hunter]]: Can make the Alchemist evil, to go full circle to have the Minion ability go back to being used by evil. 
- [[Cerenovus]]: The process is no different whether someone is made mad by the [[Cerenovus]] or the Alchenovus, they’re still shown the [[Cerenovus]] token and the token they are mad as. 
- [[Chambermaid]]: The Alchemist wakes on N1 due to their ability to find out what Minion ability they have, after that it depends on which Minion ability they got.
- [[Evil Twin]]: The “opposing twin” would be an evil player. If the good Twinchemist is executed, evil wins. [[Fearmonger]]: The announcement is the same as for the [[Fearmonger]] – “A player has been chosen with the [[Fearmonger]] ability”. 
- [[Goblin]]: Very technically RAW, the [[Goblin]] ability specifically requires the Alchoblin to claim [[Goblin]], not Alchemist [[Goblin]] in order to win when executed. Realistically, it’s pretty harsh to not allow these to be treated as the same thing. 
- [[Legion]]: The Alchemist cannot get the Legion ability – [[Legion]] doesn’t register as a Minion until it’s in play. 
- [[Lil’ Monsta]]: If LM is in play and therefore there are no out of play Minion abilities available, It’s not the end of the world if the Alchemist duplicates an in-play ability. Generally, it’s better to just make sure there’s 5+ Minions on an Alchemist/[[Lil’ Monsta]] script to avoid this scenario. The Alchemist is not a Minion, so does not wake to choose the babysitter for the [[Lil' Monsta]].
- [[Marionette]]: Don’t make the Alchemist the [[Marionette]] if you can avoid it, it’s not fun or interesting. In both cases (Alchemist who gains the [[Marionette]] ability or [[Marionette]] who thinks they're the Alchemist) the only resolution I can see is to just treat them as a poisoned/drunk Alchemist and tell them the wrong ability and not have it affect anyone. In both cases the Demon would learn who the Marionette is and would be their neighbour. If it's an Alchemist with the [[Marionette]] ability, the Demon would immediately know this as they wouldn't have been shown them as a Minion during Demon info. 
- [[Pit-Hag]]: If the [[Pit-Hag]] creates the Minion that the Alchemist has the ability of, the Alchemist would change ability if there is still an out-of-play Minion ability available. If there is no out-of-play Minion ability remaining, the Alchemist could either keep the same ability or change to a different in-play ability. If an Alchemist ever changes ability, they should be told – I’d recommend showing the “you are” token, followed by the Alchemist token and new Minion token. 
- [[Spy]]/[[Widow]]: jinxed - "The Alchemist cannot have the [[Spy]]/[[Widow]] ability."
## Tips and Tricks
- You know one Minion that is not in play. Let the good team know this as soon as you can. It might not seem like much, but knowing for certain that their is no [[Poisoner]] in play could mean that there are no good players getting false information.

- Minion abilities tend to be much more powerful than Townsfolk abilities, so never sacrifice yourself for the greater good if you can help it.

- Your strategy almost entirely depends on which Minion ability you have. If you are uncertain what to do, stay silent and wait for a day or so until you figure it out. Sometimes, you may want to reveal that you are the Alchemist early on, sometimes after a day or two, and sometimes not until you have died.

- If you have an ability that can directly hurt a single evil player, such as the [[Poisoner]], [[Assassin]], [[Pit-Hag]], [[Psychopath]], or [[Witch]], then pay attention to who is bluffing as what and cast a suspicious eye over anyone who's story doesn't add up. These abilities are dangerous in the hands of an evil player, but in the hands of a good player - you - they can win the game if you choose wisely. Make sure you use your ability before you die. It's worth risking killing / poisoning / making mad / changing the character of a good player or two, just in case you get an evil player in the mix.

- If you have an ability that can directly help a single good player, such as the [[Devil's Advocate]] or [[Pit-Hag]], then talk to the good players and see who is the most trustworthy. Help them with your ability as much as you can, preferably only revealing who you are afterwards.

- If you have an ability that can win the game for the good team directly, such as the [[Fearmonger]] or the [[Goblin]], then it is probably best to let the whole group know that you are the Alchemist and what your Minion ability is. That way, the good team can orchestrate a good win fairly easily. However, you will need to convince them that you are a good player and not just a Minion bluffing as the Alchemist, as the good team would lose if this were the case. Work with other players that can confirm good players, such as the [[Town Crier]] or the [[Seamstress]] to confirm your identity. If you need to, work in secret until you think that the good team will take a chance and use your ability deliberately. You may only get one shot at this, since once the evil team learns that you are the Alchemist with a game-winning ability, you are likely to die the next night.

- If you have an ability that changes the number of Outsiders in play, such as the [[Godfather]] or [[Baron]], then you should still have a net-positive effect on the game. Adding an Outsider is definitely a negative for the good team, but this will usually come with the knowledge as to how many Outsiders are actually in play. If you know for certain that there are two Outsiders in play, for example, then approaching those Outsiders and telling them who you are, while also keeping those Outsiders alive (they are good, after all!), will be a huge boon to the good team.

- If you have an ability that at first seems that it only benefits the evil team, look closer. It may be able to be twisted to benefit the good team with some unusual play. Characters like the [[Boomdandy]], [[Evil Twin]], [[Mezepheles]], or the [[Marionette]], may look useless at first glance, but having these abilities still gives you something. If you have the [[Boomdandy]] ability, then deliberately getting yourself executed guarantees to avoid the situation where the final three alive players are all evil and good can't win. If you have the [[Evil Twin]] ability, you know a player of the opposing alignment. If you have the [[Mezepheles]] ability, then a player who tells you that that they turned evil definitely isn't the Demon and they will almost certainly vote how you tell them to. If you have the [[Marionette]] ability, then you "have the ability of a Minion that thinks that they are a good player", which means that you drew a good character token out of the bag and have no idea that you are the Alchemist - but you are sitting next to the Demon. If you think you are a good character and your ability isn't working properly, you might secretly be the Alchemist-Marionette and sitting next to the Demon, which is crucial information if you can figure it out.

- You may have a Minion ability that is a flat-out detriment to the good team, such as the [[Mastermind]], or the [[Scarlet Woman]]. In this case, the Storyteller has decided to tilt the scales in the favour of the evil team. However, in this case, ask the question "What other strange things have happened in the game setup?". It is likely that the Storyteller has added a lot of excellent information Townsfolk characters with no poisoning or drunkenness, or has a particularly powerful character interaction in play, such as the [[Washerwoman]] knowing who the [[Mayor]] is, or the [[Chef]] receiving an unusually high number. If the Storyteller set the game up to be balanced, a little bit of outside-the-box thinking goes a long way. Also, look for particular character combinations that you can use to your advantage. If you have the [[Scarlet Woman]] ability and the Demon is the [[Imp]], then tricking the Imp into killing themselves at night will make you into the good Imp - much to the surprise of the evil team, assuredly. If you have the [[Mastermind]] ability, then check that there isn't a [[Heretic]] in play, just in case your ability is there to save the day. However, the Storyteller may have just decided to throw a curve-ball to the good team, and given you a Minion ability that helps the evil team overall, just for the sake of an unpleasant surprise. Storytellers are tricky like that. Be wary.

- The Alchemist is jinxed with the [[Spy]] and the [[Widow]]. The Alchemist can not currently have these abilities. However, the [[Djinn]] jinx may be updated at a later time to allow these characters to interact.
## Bluffing
When bluffing as the Alchemist, there are a few things you should keep in mind:

- If you are a Minion, bluffing as the Alchemist is easy. All you need to do is to tell the group that you have your Minion ability, which is true, but that you are the Alchemist, which is false. You are *practically* telling the truth! This works especially well if you can confirm your identity by some public effect, such as there being an extra two Outsiders in play due to your [[Baron]] ability, or getting yourself executed as the [[Boomdandy]], or changing another's character as the [[Pit-Hag]]. The benefit of coming out as the Alchemist and revealing your real Minion ability in this way, is that the good team will think that you are good, keep you alive for as long as possible, and confuse any dependant information, such as that from the [[Empath]] or the [[Tea Lady]].

- If you are bluffing as the Minion that you really are, be patient. The good team is unlikely to execute a player claiming to be the [[Goblin]] just on a whim, even if that player claims to be good. The good team is unlikely to execute the player that you choose with your [[Fearmonger]] ability for the same reason. They might, but they will usually want to confirm that you are good and willing to be a team player first. So, be patient, let the good players give you some advice, be seen to be a team player, and let the good team make up their own mind to "win" with your ability. Nudges tend to work better than frothing enthusiasm, but every group is different.

- When bluffing as a Minion that is not in play, make sure that neither of those Minions have too great of a public tell. For example, if you are the [[Baron]], but are claiming to be the Alchemist-[[Fearmonger]], then that won't slide, since the good team will know whether the Baron or the Fearmonger is really in play. (The Baron adds two Outsiders, which is fairly obvious, and the Fearmonger is declared by the Storyteller).

- Bluffing as the Alchemist and claiming that a different Minion ability is in play than what really is, can be a great way to throw the good team off the scent. Particularly in one-Minion games, the good team gains a significant advantage when they know which Minion is in play, because they also learn which Minions are not in play. If you can convince them that there is not an [[Poisoner]], [[Mastermind]], or [[Goblin]] in play when there actually is, that could win the game.
