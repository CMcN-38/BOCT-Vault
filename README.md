# Unofficial Blood on the Clocktower Obsidian Vault

## Summary
An obsidian vault for managing rules clarifications quickly and easily while offline. The majority of the information contained is taken from the Official wiki (https://wiki.bloodontheclocktower.com/Main_Page), with additional information taken from both the unofficial discord server and ad-hoc rules clarifications.

The vault also has minor support for tracking wins and losses with characters.

## Installation
The vault is best experienced through the use of the obsidian.md app, available for free at https://obsidian.md/, though all files are plain text and can be viewed as such.

```
git clone git@github.com:CMcN-38/BOCT-Vault.git
```

## Roadmap
- [] Find a Better ColorScheme
- [] Add Support for Dataview
